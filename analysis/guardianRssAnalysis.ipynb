       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journalist &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\"&gt;Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/a&gt; was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures &lt;a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\"&gt;dropped out&lt;/a&gt; of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\"&gt;10 richest sportspeople&lt;/a&gt; owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\"&gt;suspension from Paris St-Germain&lt;/a&gt; this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

       "      <td>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures dropped out of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”. But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s 10 richest sportspeople owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s suspension from Paris St-Germain this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

       "250  <p>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p><p>The journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\">concluded</a> that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\">dropped out</a> of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.</p><p>But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\">10 richest sportspeople</a> owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\">suspension from Paris St-Germain</a> this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

Days out from Charles’s coronation in London, campaigners for republic and reparations movements in 12 countries have written a letter asking the new monarch to start a process towards “a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence”.

Or maybe it’s just that the reputation of prime minister’s questions now precedes it. The last few PMQs have been excruciating for all concerned.

       "250  Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures dropped out of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”. But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s 10 richest sportspeople owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s suspension from Paris St-Germain this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It requires only the professionalism to set partisanship aside when enacting government policy. That might not always be easy, and trust is not always in ready supply. Hence controversy over Labour’s recruitment of Sue Gray, a former Cabinet Office official, to serve as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. Ms Gray authored a report last year on illegal lockdown parties in Downing Street. Boris Johnson said that the investigation exonerated him, but his Conservative allies subsequently argued that the whole thing was an orchestrated campaign of subterfuge against the former prime minister, and that Ms Gray’s recruitment by the leader of the opposition proves it.    \n",

Here’s why, 29 April). This is not a novel view; it is a point well made already by Nafeez Ahmed in his critique of non-violent direct action. Anti-colonial resistance in India, for example, originated from within the oppressed communities themselves. Their aim was to force the British state to respond with such violence that the brutality of the colonial regime became apparent to the majority of the British people, whose tacit consent had been necessary for the continuation of the colonial enterprise.    \n",

       "250  <p>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p><p>The journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\">concluded</a> that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\">dropped out</a> of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.</p><p>But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\">10 richest sportspeople</a> owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\">suspension from Paris St-Germain</a> this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

Days out from Charles’s coronation in London, campaigners for republic and reparations movements in 12 countries have written a letter asking the new monarch to start a process towards “a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence”.

An inexplicable urge to dash home and cover everything with red, white and blue bunting. Call it local elections fever. That time of the year when politicians head for their constituencies to declare the council to either be the best or the worst in the country. Or maybe it’s just that the reputation of prime minister’s questions now precedes it. The last few PMQs have been excruciating for all concerned. Whatever the reason, the Commons was sparsely populated for this week’s session. And most of those who did show up soon wondered why they had bothered.    \n",
       "250  Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures dropped out of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”. But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s 10 richest sportspeople owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s suspension from Paris St-Germain this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It requires only the professionalism to set partisanship aside when enacting government policy. That might not always be easy, and trust is not always in ready supply. Hence controversy over Labour’s recruitment of Sue Gray, a former Cabinet Office official, to serve as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. Ms Gray authored a report last year on illegal lockdown parties in Downing Street. Boris Johnson said that the investigation exonerated him, but his Conservative allies subsequently argued that the whole thing was an orchestrated campaign of subterfuge against the former prime minister, and that Ms Gray’s recruitment by the leader of the opposition proves it.    \n",

Here’s why, 29 April). This is not a novel view; it is a point well made already by Nafeez Ahmed in his critique of non-violent direct action. Anti-colonial resistance in India, for example, originated from within the oppressed communities themselves. Their aim was to force the British state to respond with such violence that the brutality of the colonial regime became apparent to the majority of the British people, whose tacit consent had been necessary for the continuation of the colonial enterprise.    \n",

Indeed, Alzheimer’s Society first funded Prof John Hardy’s amyloid research back in 1989, and it is only now that we are seeing the first amyloid-targeting treatments that show evidence of slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. While we await these new drugs, we need to improve the lives of people living with dementia so they can continue to live independently and remain in their own homes for as long as possible. We need new assistive technologies that use recent advances such as artificial intelligence to learn about people living with dementia and adapt to their changing conditions to help them keep doing the things that bring them fulfilment. To succeed, they must be designed with people living with dementia and their carers to truly meet their needs.    \n",

Elementary tap-ins at the far post. Slotted finishes into an empty net with the goalkeeper sprawled several yards away like a battlefield casualty. Two-yard headers levered from the shoulders of punier, more beta males. Penalties dispatched with all the certainty of a bow and arrow. These are the goals that gild the legend: the ballast, the meat and potatoes, the dull matter of which Premier League record goal hauls are made. And when we say simple, we should not labour under any delusions that what Erling Haaland does is easy. On the contrary: this is the culmination of perhaps the most audacious and complex project undertaken in English football. A club purchased and refitted with the sole aim of assembling and training a team whose sole aim is to deliver the ball into dangerous attacking areas, again and again and again and again.    \n",

The 68-year-old is starting in bold fashion in an attempt to bring back confidence to a team sorely lacking it at the wrong time of the season after collecting one point in their past five matches. The former England manager has four games to maintain Leeds’s top-flight status. Allardyce starts his tenure with the unenviable trip to Premier League champions Manchester City, followed by matches against former clubs Newcastle and West Ham, before finishing the campaign at home to Tottenham. It is a tough run-in for Leeds, who are currently out of the relegation zone on goal difference, sitting one place above Nottingham Forest in 17th, but Allardyce knows what he is getting into and wants six points to keep Leeds up.    \n",

Victims have felt there was little point in reporting unacceptable behaviour by elected members because it had been tolerated for so long, the report said. Plaid Cymru failed to implement a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment. Staff reported bullying and discrimination in the workplace. But any staff do not feel that there are safe systems to raise concerns, seek support or challenge what they see. They have seen too many instances of bad behaviour by elected members be tolerated and feel that there is little point in raising concerns. There has been a lack of collective leadership and governance across the party which has meant that these issues have worsened over the last few years. Measures are needed to detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny and to make Plaid truly and visibly welcoming to women.    \n",

       "250  <p>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p><p>The journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\">concluded</a> that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\">dropped out</a> of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.</p><p>But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\">10 richest sportspeople</a> owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\">suspension from Paris St-Germain</a> this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

Days out from Charles’s coronation in London, campaigners for republic and reparations movements in 12 countries have written a letter asking the new monarch to start a process towards “a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence”.

Or maybe it’s just that the reputation of prime minister’s questions now precedes it. The last few PMQs have been excruciating for all concerned.

       "250  Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it.

Days out from Charles’s coronation in London, campaigners for republic and reparations movements in 12 countries have written a letter asking the new monarch to start a process towards “a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence”.

An inexplicable urge to dash home and cover everything with red, white and blue bunting. Call it local elections fever. That time of the year when politicians head for their constituencies to declare the council to either be the best or the worst in the country. Or maybe it’s just that the reputation of prime minister’s questions now precedes it. The last few PMQs have been excruciating for all concerned. Whatever the reason, the Commons was sparsely populated for this week’s session. And most of those who did show up soon wondered why they had bothered. \n",

Indeed, Alzheimer’s Society first funded Prof John Hardy’s amyloid research back in 1989, and it is only now that we are seeing the first amyloid-targeting treatments that show evidence of slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. While we await these new drugs, we need to improve the lives of people living with dementia so they can continue to live independently and remain in their own homes for as long as possible. We need new assistive technologies that use recent advances such as artificial intelligence to learn about people living with dementia and adapt to their changing conditions to help them keep doing the things that bring them fulfilment. To succeed, they must be designed with people living with dementia and their carers to truly meet their needs. \n",

Elementary tap-ins at the far post. Slotted finishes into an empty net with the goalkeeper sprawled several yards away like a battlefield casualty. Two-yard headers levered from the shoulders of punier, more beta males. Penalties dispatched with all the certainty of a bow and arrow. These are the goals that gild the legend: the ballast, the meat and potatoes, the dull matter of which Premier League record goal hauls are made. And when we say simple, we should not labour under any delusions that what Erling Haaland does is easy. On the contrary: this is the culmination of perhaps the most audacious and complex project undertaken in English football. A club purchased and refitted with the sole aim of assembling and training a team whose sole aim is to deliver the ball into dangerous attacking areas, again and again and again and again. \n",

The 68-year-old is starting in bold fashion in an attempt to bring back confidence to a team sorely lacking it at the wrong time of the season after collecting one point in their past five matches. The former England manager has four games to maintain Leeds’s top-flight status. Allardyce starts his tenure with the unenviable trip to Premier League champions Manchester City, followed by matches against former clubs Newcastle and West Ham, before finishing the campaign at home to Tottenham. It is a tough run-in for Leeds, who are currently out of the relegation zone on goal difference, sitting one place above Nottingham Forest in 17th, but Allardyce knows what he is getting into and wants six points to keep Leeds up. \n",

Victims have felt there was little point in reporting unacceptable behaviour by elected members because it had been tolerated for so long, the report said. Plaid Cymru failed to implement a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment. Staff reported bullying and discrimination in the workplace. But any staff do not feel that there are safe systems to raise concerns, seek support or challenge what they see. They have seen too many instances of bad behaviour by elected members be tolerated and feel that there is little point in raising concerns. There has been a lack of collective leadership and governance across the party which has meant that these issues have worsened over the last few years. Measures are needed to detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny and to make Plaid truly and visibly welcoming to women. \n",

We dissect the rise of conflict TV ‘Should protesting be banned?” It’s not the type of debate you might expect on the ITV lunchtime chatshow Loose Women, but that’s what we got recently, when the show’s social media account casually asked viewers for their thoughts on de facto martial law. The call-out was in response to a Just Stop Oil protest disrupting the World Snooker Championship by covering a table with orange chalk, as well as animal rights protesters being arrested at the Grand National. The show’s embarrassing Twitter poll sparked quite a reaction, with almost 100% of respondents voting no, before it was hastily deleted. On the programme a few hours later, the question was rephrased to “Do disruptive protests work?” and, notably, the results of the poll were not read out, as would have been normal.

State-owned news agency Tass outlines this morning what Russia is looking to achieve with any extension of the deal. It writes: The Russian foreign ministry indicated that a further decision to extend the deal would depend on the reconnection of Rosselkhozbank [Russian state-owned agricultural bank] to the Swift payment system, the resumption of supplies of agricultural machinery, spare parts and services, the lifting of restrictions on insurance and reinsurance, the lifting of the ban on access to ports, the resumption of operation of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline, [and] unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies associated with the production and transportation of food and fertilisers. During the meeting, some issues starting with the grain initiative will be discussed. In this regard, we can say that the sides are looking warmly at the extension of the duration. Our wish is that this initiative is extended without any trouble. \n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journalist &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\"&gt;Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/a&gt; was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures &lt;a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\"&gt;dropped out&lt;/a&gt; of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\"&gt;10 richest sportspeople&lt;/a&gt; owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\"&gt;suspension from Paris St-Germain&lt;/a&gt; this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

       "      <td>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures dropped out of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”. But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s 10 richest sportspeople owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s suspension from Paris St-Germain this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

       "250  <p>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p><p>The journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\">concluded</a> that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\">dropped out</a> of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.</p><p>But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\">10 richest sportspeople</a> owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\">suspension from Paris St-Germain</a> this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.)</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Days out from Charles’s coronation in London, campaigners for republic and reparations movements in 12 countries have written a letter asking the new monarch to start a process towards “a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence”.

An inexplicable urge to dash home and cover everything with red, white and blue bunting. Call it local elections fever. That time of the year when politicians head for their constituencies to declare the council to either be the best or the worst in the country. Or maybe it’s just that the reputation of prime minister’s questions now precedes it. The last few PMQs have been excruciating for all concerned. Whatever the reason, the Commons was sparsely populated for this week’s session. And most of those who did show up soon wondered why they had bothered.    \n",
       "250  Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures dropped out of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”. But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s 10 richest sportspeople owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s suspension from Paris St-Germain this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It requires only the professionalism to set partisanship aside when enacting government policy. That might not always be easy, and trust is not always in ready supply. Hence controversy over Labour’s recruitment of Sue Gray, a former Cabinet Office official, to serve as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. Ms Gray authored a report last year on illegal lockdown parties in Downing Street. Boris Johnson said that the investigation exonerated him, but his Conservative allies subsequently argued that the whole thing was an orchestrated campaign of subterfuge against the former prime minister, and that Ms Gray’s recruitment by the leader of the opposition proves it.    \n",

Here’s why, 29 April). This is not a novel view; it is a point well made already by Nafeez Ahmed in his critique of non-violent direct action. Anti-colonial resistance in India, for example, originated from within the oppressed communities themselves. Their aim was to force the British state to respond with such violence that the brutality of the colonial regime became apparent to the majority of the British people, whose tacit consent had been necessary for the continuation of the colonial enterprise.    \n",

Indeed, Alzheimer’s Society first funded Prof John Hardy’s amyloid research back in 1989, and it is only now that we are seeing the first amyloid-targeting treatments that show evidence of slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. While we await these new drugs, we need to improve the lives of people living with dementia so they can continue to live independently and remain in their own homes for as long as possible. We need new assistive technologies that use recent advances such as artificial intelligence to learn about people living with dementia and adapt to their changing conditions to help them keep doing the things that bring them fulfilment. To succeed, they must be designed with people living with dementia and their carers to truly meet their needs.    \n",

Elementary tap-ins at the far post. Slotted finishes into an empty net with the goalkeeper sprawled several yards away like a battlefield casualty. Two-yard headers levered from the shoulders of punier, more beta males. Penalties dispatched with all the certainty of a bow and arrow. These are the goals that gild the legend: the ballast, the meat and potatoes, the dull matter of which Premier League record goal hauls are made. And when we say simple, we should not labour under any delusions that what Erling Haaland does is easy. On the contrary: this is the culmination of perhaps the most audacious and complex project undertaken in English football. A club purchased and refitted with the sole aim of assembling and training a team whose sole aim is to deliver the ball into dangerous attacking areas, again and again and again and again.    \n",

The 68-year-old is starting in bold fashion in an attempt to bring back confidence to a team sorely lacking it at the wrong time of the season after collecting one point in their past five matches. The former England manager has four games to maintain Leeds’s top-flight status. Allardyce starts his tenure with the unenviable trip to Premier League champions Manchester City, followed by matches against former clubs Newcastle and West Ham, before finishing the campaign at home to Tottenham. It is a tough run-in for Leeds, who are currently out of the relegation zone on goal difference, sitting one place above Nottingham Forest in 17th, but Allardyce knows what he is getting into and wants six points to keep Leeds up.    \n",

Victims have felt there was little point in reporting unacceptable behaviour by elected members because it had been tolerated for so long, the report said. Plaid Cymru failed to implement a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment. Staff reported bullying and discrimination in the workplace. But any staff do not feel that there are safe systems to raise concerns, seek support or challenge what they see. They have seen too many instances of bad behaviour by elected members be tolerated and feel that there is little point in raising concerns. There has been a lack of collective leadership and governance across the party which has meant that these issues have worsened over the last few years. Measures are needed to detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny and to make Plaid truly and visibly welcoming to women.    \n",

After dining on Thursday evening at the Palace Hotel’s Amar restaurant, the trio posed for a photograph with employees. The picture was posted on Instagram by staff member Pol Perello and captioned: “Pleasures that this job brings you!!” ,  Qatari banker offers around £5bn for 100% of club Interested parties needed to make offers by 10pm BST on Friday Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have lodged final bids for Manchester United by Friday’s 10pm BST deadline. The offers are markedly less than the £6bn valuation of the club’s owners, the Glazers. Sheikh Jassim, a Qatari banker, remains intent on purchasing 100% of the club but will not pay more than what he believes United are worth. The Guardian understands this is around £5bn, roughly £1bn below the American family’s asking price. ,  Si leads 14-10 after one of the best sessions ever seen Mark Selby leads Mark Allen 7-6 in gruelling semi-final Luca Brecel staged a brave fightback to stay in his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Si Jiahui in one of the most exciting sessions witnessed at the Crucible.

Dortmund are on 61 points with four matches remaining, two points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich, who will move top if they beat bottom club Hertha Berlin on Sunday. , Colombian author’s En Agosto Now Vemos (We’ll See Each Other in August) had been just a rumour but now fans will get to read it Rumours had long circulated that an entire literary masterpiece, never seen by the public, could still be lying in a dusty safe held by the late author’s family or under lock and key at his archive at the University of Texas. On Friday Penguin Random House confirmed that an unpublished Gabriel García Márquez novel – titled En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We’ll See Each Other in August) – not only exists, but will be on shelves across Latin America in 2024. , Tree design includes names of Commonwealth nations, and poles are made from tree from Windsor estate The king and the queen consort will be anointed behind a specially created screen of fine embroidery, held by poles hewn from an ancient windblown Windsor oak and mounted with eagles cast in bronze and gilded in gold leaf, Buckingham Palace has announced. The anointing screen has been blessed at a special service at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, and will be used at what historically has been viewed as the most sacred moment of the coronation. , Wikimedia UK says it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill Wikipedia could be made inaccessible to UK readers due to issues over complying with the online safety bill, a charity affiliated with the website has warned.

The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. , Forty-year-old festival sees chefs use power tools to mix the eggs before a fork lift hoists the enormous frying pan into place Using 8,400 eggs, 25kg of venison sausage and 14 bottles of salt and pepper, New Caledonia’s giant omelette festival aims to bring people together in a region that is often divided. “It is important to have festivals like this.

It should be quite a finale, with a world-record crowd for a women’s game in excess of 53,000 expected at Twickenham as the Red Roses go head-to-head with France in a winner-takes-all Six Nations decider. The record currently stands at 42,579, set at the World Cup final at Eden Park in November. The attendance is also sure to smash the current Women’s Six Nations record, set last weekend with 18,604 watching France v Wales at the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. , In the best traditions of Fergie-time, substitute Millie Turner headed home the latest possible winning goal to help Manchester United stretch their lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to six points. The centre-back converted Katie Zelem’s much-disputed free-kick three minutes into added time to keep United’s dreams of a league and FA Cup double alive. , Different reports fly around while Fox News declines to comment on the cancellation of top TV host’s show The exact reason behind the rightwing TV host Tucker Carlson’s abrupt firing from Fox News remains unclear, days after the star’s show was suddenly cancelled. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Carlson was fired after executives discovered vulgar text messages, including one in which he called a top executive the C-word. There were also concerns among Fox management that Carlson was acting as if he was above the network, the Journal reported. , UN’s arbitrary detention group calls for immediate release of Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, saying detention has no basis in law A UN body has declared that the detention of a long-term Guantánamo inmate, Abu Zubaydah, has no lawful basis and called for his immediate release, warning that the systemic deprivation of liberty at the camp may “constitute crimes against humanity”. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD), also declared the UK, among other countries, was “jointly responsible for the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of Mr Zubaydah” over his more than 20 years in detention. , US supreme court justice, who wrote Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, denies claims he was responsible for leak in draft form Samuel Alito said the decision he wrote removing the federal right to abortion made him and other US supreme court justices “targets of assassination” but denied claims he was responsible for its leak in draft form. “Those of us who were thought to be in the majority, thought to have approved my draft opinion, were really targets of assassination,” Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. , Yemeni authorities said ‘suspicious’ and unresponsive ship opened fire, while ship manager reports clash with pirates Armed guards aboard a yacht once owned by the late Welsh actor Richard Burton have fired on approaching ships in the Gulf of Aden, prompting an intense gunfight. Yemeni authorities said the guards mistakenly opened fire on a Coast Guard vessel but the ship’s manager insisted they had clashed with pirates. The shooting reportedly killed one Yemeni Coast Guard member and wounded another person in a hail of gunfire – the guards are said to have shot as many as 200 rounds of ammunition. The incident shows the danger faced by both shippers and security forces in the waters off the Arab world’s poorest country, even as it remains crucial for global commerce. , Crowning of King Charles expected to pass quietly in New Zealand, though there is still some fascination with the crown In town halls and social media groups, New Zealand’s most committed royalists are planning high teas, concerts, and watching parties. For the most dedicated, the memorabilia will be out on display: tea sets and replica tiaras, lifetime collections of Woman’s Weekly front pages and special edition photo books. For others, however – including some of the country’s dedicated royal watchers – the coronation cupcakes and cucumber sandwiches come with a side of doubt, over the future of the monarchy and the changing way that it is viewed in colonised countries. Elizabeth Garlick will watch the coronation live, late into the night, with a group of other royal fans who are planning wine, cheese, and possibly tiaras. She says she fell in love with the royals as a small child, seeing princess Diana in the news, and over time became a “royal watcher” – keeping track of major events in the monarchy’s timeline. “I grew up in a family of other royal watchers – my great aunties, my great nana has [the queen’s] coronation on vinyl,” she says. “For me, this is like a once in a lifetime – a historical moment.” , Evacuations from Sudan, battle raging in Bakhmut, protests against a judicial overhaul in Israel and climate activism in Berlin: the most striking images this week , Government announces end to airlifts amid calls for NHS doctors without UK passports to be rescued British nationals trapped in Sudan have until midday on Saturday local time to get on a flight before they stop, ministers have announced, as a doctors’ union called for NHS medics without UK passports to also be airlifted. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Friday night more than 1,500 people had been flown out, and there had been a “significant decline in British nationals coming forward”, meaning it was time to end the operation. , Four main teaching unions could unite after ‘months of stonewalling’ from education secretary Gillian Keegan All state schools in England could be closed by “unprecedented” coordinated strikes involving all four teaching unions, after their leaders vowed to increase pressure on the government to improve its pay offer. In a joint press conference, the leaders of the four major education unions said they wanted to send a message to the education secretary that she needed to resume negotiations over pay and school funding. , The Conservative party has been too involved in the debasement of public life for too long to be entrusted with its rehabilitation The advertisement for the job of BBC chair for which Richard Sharp successfully applied in November 2020, and from which he resigned on Friday, stipulated that candidates declare any “real or perceived conflict of interest”. Care should be taken over issues that could “be misconstrued, cause embarrassment, or cause public confidence in the appointment to be jeopardised”. One such issue, in Mr Sharp’s case, was helping facilitate guarantees for a personal loan of up to £800,000 from a Canadian financier to Boris Johnson, then prime minister. When asked by the advisory assessment panel that gave the green light for his appointment about perceived conflicts of interest, Mr Sharp said everything had been properly declared. It had not. A report into the process, published on Friday, found that omission to be an unambiguous breach of the rules. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. , Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach has declared that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, has said that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings. But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration. Mr Loach is 86 and Mr Auerbach is 92 on Saturday, and they are still working. For all the challenges of age that both report, they continue to command the heights of their respective vocations – as does another great 92-year‑old artist Bridget Riley, who is about to unveil her first ceiling painting at the British School in Rome. , Conservative party accused of undermining broadcaster by flooding it with cronies after chair’s resignation Rishi Sunak is under pressure to stop appointing Conservatives to key positions at the BBC after Richard Sharp’s resignation prompted criticism the party had undermined the broadcaster by flooding it with cronies. Sharp quit as BBC chair on Friday morning after an investigation concluded he had failed to disclose key information about his relationship with the former prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job in 2021. Sharp helped facilitate an £800,000 loan guarantee for Johnson when he was in the running to take over the broadcaster but did not tell the appointments panel. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter and child cruelty by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , Record heat in southern Europe and chilly start to British growing season spell more misery for shoppers Shoppers have been warned they face more fruit and vegetable shortages, as temperatures in southern Spain soar to unprecedented levels while the UK growing season gets off to a late start because of cold, overcast weather. Temperatures were expected to reach a new April record of 39C (102F) in parts of Andalucía on Friday amid a long-lasting drought that has affected the production of vegetables in Spain. Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday. , Submarine rescue vessel SS-750 was photographed in Baltic four days before still-unexplained explosions, says Danish newspaper A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just prior to the mysterious September blasts, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage confirmed the existence of the hitherto publicly unknown photographs. , South African magnate hopes there will be bidder in auction who prefers 1,993 rare creatures to a superyacht Wanted: an animal-loving billionaire who might consider buying 1,993 threatened white rhinos instead of a new superyacht or a Picasso, or a Picasso onboard a superyacht. John Hume, a South African multimillionaire who started a rhino breeding project with about 200 animals 30 years ago, is selling all the rhinos and the 8,500-hectare (21,000 acres) conservation ranch where they live in what must rank as one of the most unusual ever online auctions. , Council’s preparations are under way but excitement is muted and some say they are unlikely to watch Chris Booth spent much of Tuesday morning supervising the installation of a crown 4.2 metres wide on the stone columns at the front of Nottingham’s Council House. The crown had been brought out of a council depot (where it is stored alongside a vast goose that appears annually for the Nottingham goose fair), repainted and had had its plastic pearls retrofitted with LED bulbs so they can be lit up at night. , Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets. Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in Avengers: Infinity War but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone). , Current science suggests that chrono-activity or adjusting our regimes to suit our body clocks, plus short, sharp workouts, are the key to a beneficial exercise routine Thousands of us have started 2023 with new exercise programmes promising to get us fit, muscle-bound and slim. But the latest science of chrono-exercise (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it. Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym. ,  Max Verstappen will start second on grid for Sunday’s race Hamilton fifth but Russell 11th after disappointing Q2 After a frustrating and stultifying opening to the new Formula One season, Ferrari finally have a moment to savour. How much it meant was clear as Charles Leclerc climbed from his car having taken pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and vigorously pointed to the prancing horse logo on his chest. Pumped by an immaculate performance, he and the Scuderia will view this as the belated opening to 2023 they wanted – but what follows this weekend will more accurately define the scale of their challenge to a dominant Red Bull. Leclerc has taken a battering in the opening three races. He suffered an engine failure in Bahrain, a 10-place grid penalty in Saudi Arabia and was unlucky to be punted out of the race on the first lap in Australia. After a week in which he has had to dismiss rumours of talks with Mercedes to join the team should Lewis Hamilton retire, and in which it was announced that Ferrari’s racing director, Laurent Mekies, is to leave to replace Franz Tost as team principal at AlphaTauri – a blow after the recent loss of technical director David Sanchez to McLaren – Leclerc delivered reason for the embattled team to finally breathe out. ,  Former England captain was strategic adviser to the ECB T20 could have two divisions and 18 teams Andrew Strauss has left his roles as strategic adviser to the England and Wales Cricket Board and chair of the performance cricket committee only three weeks after the changes to the structure of domestic cricket he recommended in last year’s high performance review were declared “dead in the water” by Richard Gould, the governing body’s chief executive. The announcement came on the day it emerged that the men’s Hundred could be abandoned in favour of a new Twenty20 competition, with the ECB said to be concerned the new format has failed to catch on internationally and was not as appealing to the cream of international talent as the widely played alternative. ,  French Open finalist’s struggles continue on clay ATP announces live electronic line calling across Tour One of the greatest challenges of being a top tennis player is remaining one, year after year, even as the rest of the field conspires to tear you down. In the first few months of his sophomore season among the elite, Casper Ruud continues to exemplify that struggle. Ruud, the French Open runner up last year, suffered another early loss on clay, losing 6-3, 6-4 to young Italian Matteo Arnaldi in the second round of the Madrid Open. A year ago, Ruud had reached the fourth round of a grand slam only once. Although he was already a top 10 player, he had a reputation for specialising in clay and thriving in the smaller events. The Norwegian blew every expectation out of the water in his breakthrough season, reaching finals at the French Open, US Open, ATP Finals and Miami Open. A match away from the top spot in New York, he finished the season having reached a career high ranking of No 2. , This debacle brought together a foolish man and a dishonest prime minister, but it also highlights the urgent need for systemic reform A word of advice for anyone who has worked hard to acquire a reputation they cherish: if Boris Johnson approaches, if he comes anywhere near, run a mile. Richard Sharp is the latest proof that, even out of office, Johnson continues to act as reputational napalm, laying waste to careers and turning good names bad. Sharp joins a long list that includes Christopher Geidt, who had the poison task of serving as Johnson’s adviser on ethics; Allegra Stratton, whom the former prime minister said had “sickened” him when she joked about a party in Downing Street, even though he had attended several himself; and the one-time rising star civil servant and current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, quoted this week as having said of Johnson, “I don’t know what more I can do to stand up to a prime minister who lies”. Each entered Johnson’s circle as a respected figure; each was diminished by their contact with the reverse Midas, the man who rots everything he touches. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist , Readers respond to Emma Beddington’s article about the embarrassment she felt at the state of the country when her French in-laws came to visit Emma Beddington writes about being embarrassed by the state of Britain when her French in-laws visited, citing various ways in which the country compares poorly with France (I saw the UK through the eyes of my French in-laws – and it was deeply embarrassing, 23 April). But she ends on a positive note, describing how her in-laws were impressed on a train when they saw “a lovely group of women sitting next to us in Hawaiian garlands, enjoying prosecco at 8am”. If that is the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s not much. I can understand Beddington’s “countrybarrassment”. Especially because there is no other country I have been so much in love with as Britain. For some 60 years, I travelled its length and breath, reading its literature, enjoying its arts. Its people were always welcoming – at least, that is what I thought, and I still think that most of the time the friendliness is sincere. , Readers lament the damage to culture resulting from the government cutting funding Sir Simon Rattle is right to voice his anxiety about the state of classical music in the UK (Simon Rattle is right: Britain is becoming a cultural desert – and that’s a political choice, 26 April). He is concerned for the future of orchestras, opera houses and large choirs as public financial subsidies dry up. I am the secretary of a very small concert-promoting society in north Hertfordshire. We too have lost local authority support, but even more concerning is the diminishing size of our audiences. , Garden charity no longer categorises slugs and snails as pests but sells items that harm them, say critics The Royal Horticultural Society has been criticised for continuing to sell products that kill wildflowers and insects, despite public messaging about protecting biodiversity. Last year, the RHS said slugs and snails would no longer be classed as pests. The leading garden charity said they were an important part of the garden ecosystem and “play an important role in planet-friendly gardening”. , Vaughn Dolphin, from Walsall, West Midlands, had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot A far-right extremist who accidentally set off a “fireball” in his own kitchen while experimenting with explosives has been convicted of terrorism offences. Vaughn Dolphin, who had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot, was found guilty on a series of charges after a jury viewed videos and incriminating conversations on social media. , With dwindling real-terms pay still a sore point, Whitehall staff feel the  Raab bullying case has only unleashed more hostility “Almost every civil servant I talk to is looking for a way out,” says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now an expert on Whitehall. It’s hardly a surprise after the past few years: civil servants have been demonised as workshy by former Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, blamed for the Partygate scandal by Boris Johnson and threatened with 91,000 job cuts. , Decision welcomed by victim after judge decided not to jail Sean Hogg from South Lanarkshire for the offence A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , Upmarket homewares and clothing retailer sees pretax profits rise 18% in post-lockdown recovery The family behind The White Company have given themselves at least £50m in payments as the upmarket homewares and clothing brand bounces back from the pandemic lockdowns. The company paid a £50m dividend to an entity controlled by the founder, Chrissie Rucker, and her husband, Nicholas Wheeler, the founder of the shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt. The group’s highest paid director, thought to be Rucker, took a further £5m in pay, up from £675,000 a year before, as a long-term bonus plan cashed in. , Woman and child die in Dnipro, while missile strikes in Uman, south of Kyiv, kill 19  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 19 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. , Nation’s guidelines say no donor should father more than 25 children in 12 families Dutch judges have ordered a man suspected of fathering more than 550 children through sperm donations to stop donating, in the latest fertility scandal to shock the Netherlands. The man, identified in Dutch media only as Jonathan M, 41, was taken to court by a foundation protecting the rights of donor children and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. , Rapporteurs also chastise the German and Namibian governments for excluding Herero and Nama minorities from talks dealing with the mass murder of their ancestors UN special rapporteurs have criticised the German and Namibian governments for violating the rights of Herero and Nama ethnic minorities by excluding them from talks over reparations for colonial crimes against their ancestors. Publishing their communication with both governments, the seven UN representatives urged Germany to take responsibility for all its colonial crimes in Namibia – including mass murder – and said it was wrong for the Herero and Nama to have been involved indirectly in talks via an advisory committee. They called on Germany to pay reparations directly to the Herero and Nama and not to the Namibian government. , Ricot Jean found dead after reportedly being kidnapped and Dumesky Kersaint reportedly killed by a stray bullet Two more journalists have been killed in Haiti in the past month as rampant gang violence has gripped the capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Ricot Jean, who worked for Radio-Tele Evolution Inter was found dead on Tuesday, a day after he was reportedly kidnapped by men wearing police uniforms. Jean was a prominent cultural activist in the Haitian capital and hosted a weekly radio show. , Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandalsFor the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films. This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other. , The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work • James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599 Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”. In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.” , Authors, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month. Join the conversation in the comments In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they have been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a memoir that wrestles with singleness, poetry that feels alive and excellent audiobooks.

The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added. This ginger, honey and citrus take on the idea involves a blender rather than a bia wun, and uses orange and lime juice instead of the more traditional calamansi juice. It’s a great refreshing drink to welcome the first warm days of spring – and to keep up your sleeve for the hotter months to come. Luke Farrell, Speedboat Bar, London W1 , On her travels Petrina Darrah would often send her mother photographs, then receive a picture of the same place three decades earlier in return  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email When I told my mum I was taking my younger sister to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she could barely contain her excitement. Thirty years before we set foot in Goma, our mother arrived in the same city on a dusty Bedford truck that had carted a swag of lanky youths all the way from London. Back then, the DRC was called Zaire and civil war had yet to tear the region apart. Mum remembers Goma as being quite cosmopolitan. , Fox News settlement seen as ‘moment of weakness’ that puts focus on  mogul’s heirs and their future “Rupert has shown a rare sign of weakness,” says one longtime Murdoch watcher. “There is something of the smell of blood in the water.” In the space of two weeks the 92-year-old’s media empire has taken a reputational hammering on both sides of the Atlantic, putting a renewed focus on the future shape of the global conglomerate’s businesses – and who will run them. , At Omdurman’s open-air market, half of the stalls are shut, customers are scarce and money is tight “I haven’t sold anything since 6am today,” said Adam Musa, a vegetable seller at Omdurman’s open-air market, as fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces raged a few miles away. “There are no people buying.” Musa, 55, faced two problems: a lack of customers, and an inability on the part of those who did come to pay what he was charging. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine. Euromaidan, Kyiv Operativ and Faytuks news have posted videos of the reported attack, which shows a large part of a residential building totally blown apart. It is unknown at this stage how many people were inside. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp. What he did there – and his role in the investigation of three deaths –remains controversial In the middle of a June night 17 years ago in the Guantánamo prison camp, guards and medical orderlies were urgently summoned to one of the inmate clinics, where an emergency was unfolding. Two inmates, Ali Abdullah Ahmed and Mani Shaman al-Utaybi, had been brought in dead. A third, Yasser Talal al-Zahrani, had been rushed to the hospital on the US naval base but was declared dead there soon afterwards. The three men were found hanging from their necks, with their hands and feet bound and rags in their throats. ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments? You can email John or tweet him Quotes coming in to preview Sunday’s games, though a lot of these will come from last night, and have been embargoed. Eddie Howe’s gone BIG with this comparison for Newcastle Alexander Isak. There are no two players who are the same but I think he does have some of the characteristics that Thierry Henry had. He has certainly got the speed and is a similar build and frame. Also the footwork. The assist [against Everton] was truly remarkable, really. He has got a lot of potential to improve and get better, but it’s been a great start for him here. Henry joined Brentford in 2016. They were a Championship side and he thought they were a stepping-stone club. He soon realised he was wrong. On Wednesday night Brentford went to Chelsea and won 2-0. They are ninth in the Premier League before hosting Nottingham Forest on Saturday and have a chance of qualifying for Europe. Brentford know how to maximise their resources. They did not panic when Smith went to Villa in 2018. Thomas Frank was an inspired appointment. The Dane led Brentford into the top flight in 2021 and has built a young, hungry side. Brentford flourished after winning promotion and have kept standards high this season. “They say the second season’s the hardest,” Henry says. “But we’ve stayed together. The gaffer said: ‘Don’t take your foot off the pedal.’ , Our selection includes a replayed shootout, a scorer of four consecutive hat-tricks and a moment to forget for Akinfenwa Much was made of the fact that, despite amassing more than 100 points each, only one of Wrexham or Notts County could win automatic promotion to the Football League. In the end the Welsh side prevailed, to the relief of their fans and Hollywood owners, consigning Notts County to the playoffs. In National League South, Ebbsfleet had no need to look over their shoulder as they hit the 100-point mark with one game remaining. The Kent side secured the title with four games to spare and sit 18 points clear of their nearest rivals, Dartford. Ebbsfleet’s march to promotion was masterminded by Dennis Kutrieb, a highly regarded young German who took over at the Stonebridge Road in June 2020, three months after the National League season was halted by the pandemic. Ebbsfleet were relegated by 0.002 of a point when clubs agreed to end the season on a points-per-game basis but have finally booked their return to the fifth tier. , The selection attempts to become only the second horse to follow up a Scottish Grand National victory at Sandown Kitty’s Light would be a hugely popular winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup on Jumps Finale day at Sandown on Saturday, and Christian Williams, his trainer, believes the seven-year-old has the right attitude and constitution to follow up his success in the Scottish Grand National last weekend. “He’s freakish for a horse,” Williams said this week. “The way he comes out of his races, you’ll never have seen anything like it. Basically, you could nearly run him in the next race as he recovers so quickly, so there’s something inside him. I’m not sure if he’s got big lungs or a big heart but there’s something in him that’s different to any other horses that we’ve run.” ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email A Tennesee lawmaker who was previously outsted for calling for gun control after a Nashville mass shooting has spoken about Zephyr being silenced. In an interview with Democracy Now, Tennessee representative Justin Jones spoke with Zephyr about the need for continued solidarity. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , PM tells Scottish Tory conference that Holyrood should instead be ‘held to account’ for not using existing powers enough Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Its producer Aaron Dessner explains how they made it For Ed Sheeran, the release of a new album usually means a confident sweep to No 1 and steady dominance of the Top 40 over the subsequent months. But there is more at stake than usual for the 32-year-old songwriter when he releases his fifth album, – (Subtract), next Friday (5 May). The record documents a series of events last spring that Sheeran has characterised as the most challenging period in his life. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a tumour that couldn’t be operated on until after the birth of their second child. His best friend, music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, died aged 31 after taking cocaine. Sheeran was also subject to a high-profile UK court case in which he faced claims he had copied a pair of songwriters’ work in his 2017 smash hit single Shape of You. , New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff. The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT announced fresh action. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp.

I recommend baking them in heavily buttered muffin tins or silicone moulds; baker Julia Aden recently recommended putting a round piece of greaseproof paper in the base of each mould to help remove small cakes, and it works a treat. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine.

Their justification? That Zephyr’s interaction with protesters who were demonstrating against her earlier silencing by the House’s Republican majority amounted to “encouraging an insurrection.” The Associated Press reports that such claims have become increasingly common in recent months in state legislatures where Republicans rule. Case in point, the rhetoric used by GOP lawmakers to briefly expel two Democrats from the Tennessee state House of Representatives earlier this month. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , Officials named remains as those of Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on fishing trip in 1998 Nevada officials have identified remains found in Lake Mead as those of a Las Vegas man missing for 25 years, the latest development in a quest to identify a series of bodies discovered in America’s largest reservoir last year. On three different days last summer, visitors at a beach on the lake discovered skeletal remains along the shoreline. The Clark county coroner’s office announced on Thursday that those remains belonged to the same person, now identified as as Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on 14 July 1998 at the age of 52. , Former England captain talks about his ‘tiring’ condition in Netflix series about his life and career  What are typical symptoms and treatments for OCD? David Beckham has revealed how living with his “tiring” obsessive compulsive disorder leads him to spending hours cleaning and organising his home while the rest of his family are in bed. The former England football captain, 47, says in a forthcoming Netflix documentary: “The fact that when everyone’s in bed I then go around, clean the candles, turn the lights on to the right setting, make sure everywhere is tidy.

The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong.

You have your own losses – and young children – to deal with I am a woman in my late 30s, married with two small children with a rewarding and demanding career. I live some hours’ drive away from where I grew up and where my mum lives. I really love my life   but I need some advice regarding my relationship with my mum. My lovely dad died last year.  He was much loved and I miss him a great deal, but he gave me so much over his lifetime that I am doing OK without him. My family has probably had more loss than most. One sister died before I was born, and another older sister in her early 30s. My mum has called the loss of my dad the hardest of all. I love her very much but I feel responsible for her and guilty that I live far away.  , On his show Carlson railed against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and apologized for Putinist aggression. None of it is new Fox News has finally broken ties with its most popular star, Tucker Carlson. His ousting has been bemoaned by some commentators, who have taken Carlson to be a rebellious anti-war populist, evading easy political characterization. But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology? In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a pro-Russia monologue urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the real enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States. … It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence. , Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have both been accused of ethics violations – and John Roberts refuses to discuss the matter with Congress It was a short letter. John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, was brief in his missive to Democratic senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence”, Roberts declined to appear before the committee to discuss disturbing recent revelations of ethics violations at the court. Congress is meant to exert checks on judicial power – to investigate or even impeach judges who abuse their office or interpret the law in ways that violate its spirit, and to affirm that the elected branches will hold more sway over policy than the appointed one. But the chief justice’s show of indifference to congressional oversight authority reflects a new reality: that there are now effectively no checks on the power of the court – at least none that Democrats have the political will to use – and that the justices can be assured that they will face no repercussions even if they act in flagrant violation of ethical standards. It seems that they intend to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race. Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation. , Tyler Dupree, James Harrison and Matty Ashton have left part-time rugby league behind and are now in line to face France  Ever heard the one about the electrician, the lifeguard and the builder who went on to represent their country? There could be as many as 15 debutants when a new-look England side takes to the field against France in Warrington on Saturday afternoon, with Shaun Wane sticking to his promise of ripping up the squad that fell short in last year’s Rugby League World Cup and integrating a younger group of players in anticipation for the next tournament in France in 2025. All of those players have their own unique stories to tell, but three in particular can scarcely believe they have reached this point. As recently as 18 months ago, Tyler Dupree and James Harrison were not even full-time Super League players, with Dupree involved in the Oldham side relegated to League 1, the sport’s lowest professional tier, and Harrison playing for Featherstone Rovers. They were released by Leeds and Bradford respectively as teenagers, told they were not good enough and, cast aside from the professional ranks, forced to go part-time. , Suella Braverman flags statutory instrument to public order bill as climate protesters renew campaign Suella Braverman is to give police the power to ban slow walking in traffic by protesters, as Just Stop Oil enters the fifth consecutive day of using the tactic in the latest phase of its climate protest campaign.

       "      <td>[Figure is acceleration in casualties, with most troops killed in brutal trench warfare for eastern city of Bakhmut  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and more than 80,000 injured in just five months of fighting in Ukraine, an acceleration in already heavy losses for Moscow, US intelligence officials estimate. Most of the troops were killed in brutal trench warfare for the small eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia has repeatedly claimed it was on the brink of capturing, White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said when he revealed the new estimate on Monday. , Ukraine intercepts 15 out of 18 missiles as Moscow launches strikes apparently designed to hamper Kyiv’s plans for a counteroffensive  Russia-Ukraine war: latest news updates Russian missile strikes have injured 34 civilians and apparently damaged railway infrastructure and an ammunition depot in south-eastern Ukraine, hours before an explosion inside Russia derailed a freight train. The attacks on both sides of the border on Monday apparently aimed to disrupt military logistics before a significant Ukrainian counteroffensive against occupying Russian troops, expected to start shortly in the south or the east. , US estimates 20,000 Russian soldiers have died in five months; two killed in latest Russian strikes on Ukraine Russia’s military has suffered 100,000 casualties in the past five months in fighting against Ukraine, mostly in the Bakhmut region, the White House has estimated. National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the figure, based on US intelligence estimates, included more than 20,000 dead, half of them from the Wagner group. Russia unleashed a fresh missile attack on Ukraine in the east, killing two people, setting off huge blazes and damaging dozens of homes and other buildings in the city of Pavlohrad. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the two deaths in his video address on Monday night. “Forty other people - women, children, men – were treated for wounds and injuries,” he said. Zelenskiy also said a 14-year-boy was killed near his school when it was hit by a bomb in the Chernihiv region, close to the Russian border. An explosion in the western region of Bryansk bordering Ukraine derailed a Russian freight train on Monday, the local governor said in a social media post. “An unidentified explosive device went off, as a result of which a locomotive of a freight train derailed,” Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram, adding that there were no casualties reported. Russian authorities say the region, which borders Ukraine and Belarus, has seen multiple attacks by pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups in the 14 months since Russia invaded. Ukrainian counterattacks have ousted Russian forces from some positions in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, but the situation remains “quite difficult”, a top Ukrainian general has said. However, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, added: “At the same time, in certain parts of the city, the enemy was counterattacked by our units and left some positions.” Syrskyi made the remarks while visiting frontline troops on Sunday, the military said. The head of the Wagner private militia renewed his appeal to Russia’s defence ministry to increase ammunition shipments to his fighters trying to seize Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin has frequently clashed with Moscow’s defence establishment over the conduct of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine and what he says is insufficient support being provided to his Wagner soldiers. In a video posted on his Telegram channel, Prigozhin said he needs at least 300 tonnes of artillery shells a day for the assault, Reuters reported. Since last summer Russia has built “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades” in the areas it controls in Ukraine as well as in its own border regions, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a statement condemning the former children’s ombudsman of Russia, Pavel Astakhov, for comments he made on Russian state TV that murdering ambassadors is “within the framework of international law”, with specific reference to Poland’s ambassador. Poland called on Russia “to ensure the safety of all diplomats in accordance with the Vienna Convention”. In Washington, House speaker Kevin McCarthy emphatically stressed his support for military aid to Ukraine on Monday, criticising Russia’s “killing of the children” and distancing himself from some in his party who oppose additional major US aid to repel the Russian invasion. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken to New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins. Ukraine’s president said the pair discussed “further cooperation on defence and humanitarian issues” and “the need for further consolidation of the countries of the Pacific region in supporting Ukraine.” , Watching sea snakes swim through water is soothing – until you remember they are real Sea snakes are, in animal form, the feeling the deep end of the pool gives you when you are a child, when suddenly you feel you are swimming at night, or when you are in bed but not totally sure the floor beneath hasn’t turned into water and sharks. And because sea snakes aren’t where they’re meant to be – everything you know tells you snakes don’t belong in the sea – the more you learn about them, the more you encounter all that you don’t know: the words are weird, you understand their meaning but can’t read their letters, they are words in a dream – or was it a nightmare? Black-banded sea kraits, a type of sea snake, hunt with yellow goatfish; in New Caledonia, they are called “stripy sweaters”. Kraits are “elapid”, which means their fangs are always erect. Sea snake lungs are almost as long as their bodies; they can breathe through their skin. Their tongues are shorter than those of land snakes: only the forked part pokes out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup , A House of Lords report is right to demand action to restore lost possibilities to the under-30s An estimated three-quarters of young people aged between 18 and 24 voted remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Many did so in the conviction that leaving the European Union would turn Britain into a smaller, more insular place, closing off possibilities and prospects in their own lives. They feared a birthright was being lost; one which allowed them a bigger, wider sense of belonging. Seven years on, that judgment is vindicated in a report by a cross-party committee of the House of Lords. Entitled The Future UK-EU Relationship, the peers’ analysis finds that, since the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with Brussels in 2021, “post-Brexit barriers to mobility between the UK and the EU, in both directions, have had an especially significant impact on young people”. , Building a healthier, more prosperous country will mean addressing the problem of low-paid, precarious employment  What’s the best way to fix Britain’s economy? According to Labour and the Conservatives, the answer is growth. Yet this focus overlooks another fundamental reason for Britain’s sluggish productivity. The UK is unwell. Every year, 2% of its GDP – or £43bn – is lost due to poor health, according to new findings from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). More people are leaving work due to long-term health conditions and more are claiming disability benefits. So long as this persists, calling for growth will be like attempting to compete in a race while being too sick and exhausted to run. The reasons for Britain’s ill health have been widely discussed. Poverty is a major cause. Those on low incomes are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and struggle to afford life’s essentials. If social housing was plentiful, nutritious food subsidised and heating permanently affordable, poverty would not be as harmful to health. But a decade of cuts to public services has left those on low incomes even more exposed. Meanwhile, Whitehall has focused its energies on the NHS, viewing medical treatment as the job of the state and prevention as the responsibility of individuals. Broader health has not been a government priority – a fact signalled by the cynical decision to scrap Public Health England in 2020. , Readers take issue with Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman’s  rhetoric on asylum seekers’ ‘values’ As a volunteer with an organisation helping to support refugees and asylum seekers in Hertfordshire, I have to take issue with Robert Jenrick when he says that their “values and lifestyles” threaten the UK’s social cohesion (‘Values and lifestyles’ of small boat refugees threaten social cohesion, says Jenrick, 25 April). The asylum seekers I have met have been polite, charmingly grateful for our help and eager to get on with their lives. This means working to improve their English – at college, as soon as they are eligible – and, since asylum seekers are not allowed to earn money, keen to volunteer their services to charities and other organisations. The parents are as concerned for their children’s wellbeing as any UK parents, care for them lovingly and encourage them to work hard at school. Meanwhile, they are coping with the trauma of lives disrupted by violence, the turmoil of their journeys to get here and the stresses of living, usually in one room, in a strange country where they are dependent on the kindness of strangers for clothing, shoes and all the necessities of life. In my view, the UK will benefit immeasurably from their presence and the skills and values they bring. Vicky WoodcraftTrustee, Herts Welcomes Refugees , Sudanese crisis | Food prices | Tory foot soldiers | Value of the monarchy | Swearing allegiance I await with interest the UK government’s response to the Sudanese refugee crisis. Given the precedent of providing refuge for those escaping the war in Ukraine, we could reasonably expect that the same would apply to those fleeing violence in Sudan, and that British families would open their doors to them. After all, Britain has been far more closely associated with Sudan than with Ukraine, having had a history of occupation stretching back 150 years.Douglas CurrieEdinburgh • After reading Andy Beckett’s piece on profiteering (Britain once rioted over the price of bread. What would it take for us to confront greedflation today?, 28 April), I went for my weekly shop to a major supermarket (bill double what it used to be). I wanted a small tub of mustard and cress, but it was 60p. I went to my local farm shop, where the same thing cost me 30p.Helen PeirceTeignmouth, Devon ,  Belgian defeats four-time world champion 18-15 in final ‘This has been a crazy week, no practice, just partying’ It may have taken him nine years more than he originally planned, but Luca Brecel’s childhood prophecy has finally been fulfilled. Before he had even stepped through the doors of a Crucible Theatre as a highly-rated 17-year-old, becoming the youngest player in the tournament’s history, the Belgian had already predicted he would become world champion by the age of 19. That, clearly, did not materialise as planned. Brecel hadn’t even won a match here as recently as three weeks ago, going out in the first round on all five of his previous appearances at the Crucible. But now, snooker has its first world champion from mainland Europe and the boy who first picked up a cue as a precocious nine-year-old has delivered on his promise. ,  Wolfsburg win in extra time in WCL semi-final Eidevall says his side is ‘allowed to hurt tonight’ Jonas Eidevall said his Arsenal side is “allowed to hurt tonight and feel empty, but we are also allowed to feel proud of the performance and the occasion”, following a 3-2 semi-final defeat against Wolfsburg deep into extra time to end dreams of a place in the Champions League final. “We made it to the Champions League semi-final and lost by the tiniest of margins,” the Arsenal manager said. “With all the injuries we have, with all the challenges we have, I am incredibly proud.” , An interrogative exhibition at the New-York Historical Society examines the social, cultural and civil rights impact of development and devastation “I want people to understand that the environmental crisis is bound up inextricably in our cultural world and how we relate to each other,” Dr Wendy Nālani E Ikemoto is discussing Nature, Crisis, Consequence, which she curated for the New-York Historical Society. The show juxtaposes classics of 19th-century American naturalism with works by artists from communities largely left out of the historical narratives that these works have been central in enshrining. “It’s not just a problem of science and numbers, it is indivisible from the way we treat each other. How is the environmental crisis also a civil rights crisis?” Running through 16 July, Nature, Crisis, Consequence emerged from a request made of Ikemoto to create a show to feature the NYHS’s 19th-century Hudson River school paintings. Among the Society’s most popular holdings, the Hudson River school works show a romanticized, pastoral version of well-known landscapes upstate from New York City, now thoroughly marked by human development and activity. “They wanted them back on view because they’re so popular,” said Ikemoto, “but I didn’t want to just put these paintings back on the wall.” , Greenpeace Belgium working to release 14 protesters who sailed inflatables into the Fluxys LGN terminal in Zeebrugge Fourteen Greenpeace activists have been held for more than 48 hours after trespassing into and occupying a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal in Zeebrugge, Belgium Greenpeace Belgium said it was working for their release. Valerie Del Re, director of Greenpeace Belgium, said: “It’s not our activists, but gas companies like Fluxys who are the criminals in this story. , Exclusive: up to 10 disused cruise liners, ferries and barges sought to help tackle processing delays The Home Office is planning to use 10 redundant cruise ships, ferries and barges to house asylum seekers in ports around the country, with Liverpool expected to be next in line as ministers struggle to get to grips with the asylum backlog. Officials have been told to look at “all options” to find housing for people caught up in processing delays, including former military camps and prisons, with the total backlog more than 1,500 higher than in December when Rishi Sunak pledged to clear it within a year. , Carl O’Keeffe was taken to hospital after incident at Kong Adventure Centre but died from his injuries The family of a man who died after getting stuck in a cave at an indoor climbing centre in the Lake District say they have been left “broken-hearted”. Carl O’Keeffe, a 49-year-old man from Lancaster, was attending a birthday party with his niece in the Kong Adventure Centre in Keswick, Cumbria on 22 April, Sky News reported. , Move by senior party figures comes after fellow MP said she was worried about how force was handling crimes against woman Labour MPs have spoken to Leicestershire police after Stella Creasy expressed concern about how the force was “dealing with crimes against women” in response to their handling of her harassment case. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, and Liz Kendall, the shadow health secretary, spoke to police after Creasy criticised their handling of a harassment case against a troll who made a baseless complaint about her to social services. , Supporters claim government to rule she broke civil service code in bid to delay role as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Former senior official Sue Gray is facing a “political witch-hunt”, allies believe, with the government set to conclude that she broke the civil service code, in an alleged bid to delay her appointment as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff until after the next general election. Ministers are expected to announce on Tuesday that an internal inquiry into Gray’s departure from Whitehall has concluded that she breached the code by holding talks with Labour about the new role without informing civil service officials. , FSB says business confidence is rising but soaring costs and weakening demand is still slowing growth Small businesses across Britain are warning that the cost of living squeeze is holding back economic growth, after two in five company bosses reported a drop in sales at the start of the year. The Federation of Small Businesses said that although business confidence was rising among bosses before the summer, soaring costs and weakness in consumer demand were still weighing on activity. , Prof Marian Knight says action needed to improve diagnosis of condition in which fertilised egg implants itself outside womb  ‘Worst thing that’s ever happened to me’: the trauma of ectopic pregnancy Women are dying or suffering avoidable harm because of a failure to recognise ectopic pregnancy, one of the country’s leading experts on maternal health has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Prof Marian Knight of the University of Oxford, who leads a national research programme on maternal deaths, called for action to improve diagnosis of the acute, life-threatening condition, in which a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb, normally in the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are never viable and if left untreated can result in the tube rupturing, causing potentially fatal internal bleeding. , Critical shortages of basic goods including water, and bodies piling in streets creating ‘environmental catastrophe’ Sudanese medics have described seeing piles of bodies in the streets of the capital, Khartoum, people drinking polluted water, and doctors working under bombardments as the battle between the country’s two warring generals continues despite a threadbare ceasefire. Intense explosions and shelling were audible in Omdurman, Khartoum’s twin city across the Nile, on Monday and there were reports of further explosions and clashes in the Bahri and Kafouri districts of Khartoum North. In the south of Khartoum, residents reported that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fired anti-aircraft missiles in response to bombardments by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). , The network and Trump had a difficult relationship when he was in office, but the event could goose both of their ratings The announcement that CNN will host a New Hampshire town hall event for Donald Trump was met with widespread criticism on Monday. Angelo Carusone, chief executive of Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog, said: “The transparent attempt to goose their ratings does feel at least a little odious. But all the more reason that they need to get this right.” , Writer tells New York jury George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, encouraged her to take legal action The advice columnist E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump for rape after she was encouraged to take legal action by George Conway, the husband of a top aide to the then president. On her third day on the witness stand, Carroll told the jury hearing her lawsuit for battery and defamation over the alleged sexual assault in a New York department store changing room in 1996 that she did not intend to sue Trump until he called her a liar when she went public with her accusations more than two decades later. , Have you cringed so hard you turned into a fossil?

Today’s dishes are great for impressing vegetarian friends or family, or if you simply want a meat-free dish without feeling as if you’re missing out. If you don’t want to use tofu, swap it for crunchy veg, such as carrot, asparagus or spring cabbage, to create a contrasting texture for the noodles. , Advance raises prospect of new ways to restore speech in those struggling to communicate due to stroke or motor neurone disease An AI-based decoder that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text has been developed, in a breakthrough that allows a person’s thoughts to be read non-invasively for the first time. The decoder could reconstruct speech with uncanny accuracy while people listened to a story – or even silently imagined one – using only fMRI scan data. Previous language decoding systems have required surgical implants, and the latest advance raises the prospect of new ways to restore speech in patients struggling to communicate due to a stroke or motor neurone disease. , Discovery could help plug gaps in understanding of evolution after Cambrian explosion more than 500m years ago Many people discovered new interests closer to home as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. For Dr Joseph Botting and Dr Lucy Muir, it was a 10-metre-wide quarry in a sheep field near to their home in Llandrindod, central Wales, which appeared to be teeming with tiny fossils. Now researchers believe the site could help plug gaps in scientific understanding of how evolution proceeded after the Cambrian explosion – the period when the ancestors of most modern animals are believed to have evolved. It could even prove to be as important as the Burgess Shale in Canada that preserves one of the world’s first complex marine ecosystems, experts say. , Global fleet has more than doubled in two decades, with more private flights made last year than ever before Sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year, placing an increasing burden on the planet, while many of the owners escape aviation taxes, and there are few curbs on the greenhouse gases emitted, according to a report. The global fleet of private jets has more than doubled in the last two decades, and more private flights were made last year than ever before, according to a thinktank report published on Monday. Greenhouse gas emissions from private aviation have increased by nearly a quarter since the pandemic, when flying of all types nearly ceased in many countries for an extended period. , The Guardian’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world , Freight train derailed in border region of Bryansk; children among those injured in attack that appeared to target ammunition depot  At a glance: what we know on day 432 of the invasion Hello, and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone.

After weekend talks to prevent a further escalation of the US banking crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. The regulator is providing $50bn (£39.9bn) of financing as part of the deal. , From Lady Chatterley’s Lover to novels about trans children, attempts to suppress works of literature tend to have the opposite effect The 17th century rector of St Alban’s College in Valladolid, Spain, must have rolled his eyes at the size of the book he had to review for the library. The Jesuit seminary, known as the English College because it produced missionaries committed to the reconversion of England to Catholicism, had received a 900-page volume of Shakespeare’s plays. William Sankey prepared his quill and began the long work of censoring ungodly, anti-Catholic and otherwise unsuitable material. “Holy-day fools” – a jibe in the Tempest that seemed to impugn the Christian calendar – struck out. “Heavier soon by the weight of a man”, as Margaret tells Hero on the eve of her wedding in Much Ado About Nothing – filth – blotted into unreadability with heavy ink. A play about a pretend friar and a novice nun: actually, at Measure for Measure Sankey admitted defeat, put down his pen and took a sharp blade to cut out the pages of the entire play. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Dozens of nurses have gathered outside London’s University College Hospital, chanting and singing. Waving placards that demand fair pay and state “enough is enough”, the nurses asked how they could be expected to get by on their current pay, and said they are unable to provide acceptable care to patients due to staffing issues. As staff lined the steps of the hospital, cancer care staff nurse Preya Assi, from Hackney in east London, said: This is a culmination of our pay not reflecting the hours we are working. The last decade has made things considerably worse. Our colleagues are out in force because things have got so bad that we cannot pay our rent or our bills, we are relying on food banks. We have spent the last few years fighting the pandemic. It matters to us and the care we provide matters to us. The fact the government are not looking at our pay has caused us to do this. It’s a profession that I love, I love caring for people, and when I started the job it was not like this. The money was small, but it was sufficient, and we were proud of being a nurse. The definition of nursing is about caring for people and making them comfortable if they are at the end of their lives, but how is that possible when there is one nurse having to look after 10 patients at a time because we’re short-staffed? How am I supposed to live? If I don’t pay my council tax, they take me to court, or if I don’t pay my rent, I lose my home. At 70, I’m still working; what life is that? They are clapping for us but refuse to pay us properly. If they (politicians) were here, I would tell them to their faces. , Officials claim material on Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”. Officers on the parliamentary estate forced people attending a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on Hong Kong last Monday to hand over copies of a report by the group about press freedom there, as well as leaflets campaigning for the release of the media tycoon Jimmy Lai. , Bird flu, higher costs and the rise of meat-free options are pushing poultry producers to reduce flocks or give up entirely James Mottershead’s family has been in the chicken farming business for two decades, but nothing compares with the current situation. “Absolutely dire,” is his summary. Based in Shropshire and operating from six vast sheds that churn out 1.3m chickens a year, the business has been hit by a cocktail of pressures. , Unlike the coronation quiche, there wasn’t a broad bean in sight when we asked readers to name their most-loved combinations. From chorizo to asparagus to king trumpet mushrooms, which should you try? Compared to the super-elaborate swiss-roll-and-amaretti trifle introduced to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee last year, King Charles’s coronation quiche seems an underwhelming choice. Its chief innovation – the addition of broad beans – is seasonal but unexciting. And at the end of the day, it’s still just a quiche. Surely, we thought, Guardian readers could do better. An appeal for your own favourite quiche variations was launched. Submissions flooded in. Many refused to enter into the spirit of the exercise – “I hate quiche!” was one, not atypical response. But plenty of variations – from the humble to the exotic to the, frankly, quixotic – were offered up. I was determined to replicate three of them. , A pioneering singing programme from opera houses across Britain is bringing joy to those still struggling with little support I can’t say there’s been a lot of joy having long Covid, but something rather wonderful is happening at the London Coliseum. As part of the English National Opera (ENO) Breathe programme, more than 2,500 of us across England have been meeting in groups on Zoom to do various breathing and vocal exercises, and sing lullabies. This is not a choir, but a social prescribing intervention that uses singing techniques for breathing retraining to aid recovery from Covid-19. Many patients with long Covid have reported that they permanently feel in “flight or fight” mode and struggle to “rest and digest” as the body should. Research shows that this is because of an imbalance in our autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for subconscious processes such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and temperature regulation. Using breathing and other techniques has been shown to help engage a key nerve, the vagus, which can calm an overstimulated system to address this imbalance and put on the brakes. Joanna Herman is a consultant in infectious diseases in London, and teaches at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , With households feeling the squeeze, more retailers are offering dual-use furnishings and gadgets From colourful cushions that look as good in the living room as on the lawn to portable lamps and speakers fit for home working and garden parties, a new breed of versatile household products allows you to economise by furnishing your home and garden in one go. Traditionally, Britons have bought dedicated garden kit but with household finances under pressure and a growing desire to shop more sustainably, retailers have turned to selling “indoor-outdoor” furnishings and gadgets. “We’re seeing customers buying products that have a dual use and look just as good inside the home as they do out,” says the John Lewis head of home accessories, Camilla Rowe. , Many states have restricted how schools can teach race and gender, but only Texas has banned student interaction with elected officials The defining experience of Jordan Zamora-Garcia’s high school career – a hands-on group project in civics class that spurred a new city ordinance in his Austin suburb – would now violate Texas law. Since Texas lawmakers in 2021 passed a ban on lessons teaching that any one group is “inherently racist, sexist or oppressive”, a little-noticed provision of that legislation has triggered a massive fallout for civics education across the state. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Nine out of 10 teachers in England have a negative view of Ofsted, according to a new poll that comes amid calls to overhaul the schools inspectorate following the death of headteacher Ruth Perry. The survey of 1,000 teachers carried out by YouGov last week found that just 7% had a favourable view of Ofsted while 90% said they had an unfavourable view; including 67% who had a “very unfavourable” view of the organisation headed by chief inspector Amanda Spielman. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election? And not least of the reasons for making that the benchmark is that, if you look at what happened before the 1997 general election when Tony Blair won a landslide for Labour, Labour in the local elections leading up to 1997 were regularly recording double-digit leads in what we call the projected national share. , Officials claim material about Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”.

Prof Sir John Curtice said those wanting a clue as to who could win the next general election should be focused on the projected national vote share as the results of Thursday’s poll roll in, rather than on the number of council seats gained. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election?

But by drawing on a heritage that stretches from Birmingham to Mozambique, his new music is his most confident yet ‘Every problem you have is down there when you’re up here,” says Doya Beardmore, AKA Skinny Pelembe, overlooking his home town of Doncaster. This hillside is key to his new album, Hardly the Same Snake, its exact position revealed in morse code during one song and via clues in the artwork. He came here to de-stress when his dad was ill, before he died, and he would love to lead his listeners here via the album for a special gig. “I bet only two fucking mega-fans would turn up,” he laughs. , The particles could be linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s Researchers at the University of Vienna have discovered particles of plastic in mice’s brains just two hours after the mice ingested drinking water containing plastic. Once in the brain, “Plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s,” Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes. Adrienne Matei is a freelance journalist ,  Arsenal manager seeks end to winless run against Chelsea Frank Lampard sees Gunners as example for rebuilding Blues The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has insisted the title race “is not over”, but accepts the destiny of the trophy is “not in our hands” after his side lost 4-1 to Manchester City last week. Arteta added that his side clearly need to improve if they hope to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, starting with a win over Chelsea on Tuesday. Arsenal have been overtaken by City at the top of the table following a winless run of four games, including draws with Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton. , Newspapers’ power is being eroded and disinformation is rife – but there is a way forward Our understanding of the world is driven by information. It feeds our ability to make informed decisions about our lives, our communities, the way we’re governed. This fundamental freedom, the power to be able to access reliable information, sits at the heart of a thriving democratic society. But increasingly that power is being eroded. Indeed, some never had it to begin with. Press freedom is being threatened, compromised and denied in an increasing number of countries around the world.

Paetongtarn, the youngest daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, posted a picture of her baby, named Prutthasin Sooksawas, nickname Thasin, on social media on Monday. , Strike affecting half of NHS England trusts as pay dispute continues  Cullen has defended her union’s support for the ongoing strikes, despite previously recommending nurses accept an offer from the government. Speaking about the offer and the decision by RCN members to reject it, Cullen told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: What our nursing staff said was it was neither fair nor reasonable – it puts money in their pockets now but in the long term it doesn’t address recruitment and retention issues. There were some elements of the pay offer that were attractive to our ruling council; for example around safe nurse staffing policy work that’s required in order for us to be able to move to a place where we have safe nurse staffing legislation in place. Patients will still be seen if they unfortunately need to use an emergency department, of course that will always happen. But the delivery of care may be delayed if it is not a life-threatening emergency. If it is an emergency, you will be treated as normal. That’s why we are really emphasising the importance of people not delaying seeking medical help and calling 999 as normal or using 111. But it is inevitable that there will be disruption to normal care even in those services where we have agreed mitigations with the Royal College of Nursing. Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe. And those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition. They don’t turn their back on patients, they will continue to do what they need to do. , Fair Judgement raises funds for case in response to death of Berkshire primary headteacher Ruth Perry A group of senior school leaders is calling on teachers to donate £1 each to launch a legal challenge against Ofsted, pledging to hold the inspectorate to account for “ending careers” and causing a mental health crisis. The vice-president of the Conservative education society, John Bald, a former Ofsted inspector, is fronting a crowdfunding page for the group, which is called Fair Judgement. The leaders fear the inspectorate may seek to punish their schools if they go public.

He is expected to land in Aberdeen on Monday morning, saying on Truth Social – the social media platform he owns – that he will be opening a “spectacular” second course at the controversial Menie Estate in the north-east of the country. , Discharge of raw sewage is mainstream concern in first local elections since Guardian revealed scale of problem River pollution has become a leading issue on doorsteps during the countdown to the local elections on Thursday. Thousands of seats are being contested across England, the largest number since 2019 when the Conservatives lost control of several councils. These are the first local elections since the Guardian revealed the hidden scandal of the scale of raw sewage pollution in rivers, pushing the issue into the mainstream political debate. , The Scottish-Australian chef’s death was confirmed by his family, who said they were ‘devastated’ after he died on Sunday  Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast Jock Zonfrillo, judge on MasterChef Australia, chef and author, has died at the age of 46.

Prigozhin, whose group is spearheading Russia’s attack on the embattled city of Bakhmut, predicted a Ukrainian counterattack in mid-May and said Wagner had “only 10-15% of the shells that we need.” Pope Francis has said that the Vatican is involved in a peace mission to try to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I am willing to do everything that has to be done. There is a mission in course now but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it,” Pope Francis told reporters during a flight home after a three-day visit to Hungary. The Russian army replaced its highest ranking general in charge of logistics, after days of rumours about the sacking of Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said Alexei Kuzmenkov – a former official from the National Guard – had replaced Mizintsev as “deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation, responsible for the logistical support of the Armed Forces.” The statement did not say why Mizintsev was replaced after just seven months in the job. Ukraine said its troops were holding on to parts of the eastern city of Bakhmut. “The enemy is unable to take control over the city, despite throwing all its forces into the battle and having some success,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said its forces had taken four blocks in western Bakhmut on Sunday, according to Reuters, which could not independently confirm the claim. Four people have been killed from an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka, the governor of Russia’s western Bryansk region said on Sunday. “Two more civilians have been found and removed from the rubble. Unfortunately, both of them died,” local governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Russian commanders have likely started “punishing breaches in discipline by detaining the offending troops in ‘Zindans’ which are improvised cells consisting of holes in the ground covered with a metal grille,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. The army is thought to have been using “increasingly draconian” measures to enforce discipline since autumn 2022, the MoD said, and “especially since Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov assumed command of the operation in January 2023.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a “long and meaningful” telephone conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The French presidency said Macron had reaffirmed France’s support for Ukraine to Zelenskiy, and that Macron had given an update on European coordination to give Ukraine military help. Funerals were held for some of the 23 people who were killed on Friday when two Russian missiles hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city Uman. Six children were among the dead. With Reuters and AFP , Thirty years after the racist murder of his friend, Brooks wants to run the city whose police failed him and so many others – as a Conservative. What makes him think he can do better than Sadiq Khan? Saturday 22 April was the 30th anniversary of the day Stephen Lawrence was murdered by racist youths while waiting for a bus in south-east London. Lawrence’s family along with public figures including Keir Starmer and Sadiq Khan attended a memorial service in central London, but not his friend Duwayne Brooks, who was with him when he was attacked. “I was refereeing,” he says matter-of-factly. Like he does every weekend, for his south London football league. Not that Brooks believes the occasion shouldn’t be remembered. “In my opinion it’s got to be marked every year,” he says. “It’s not just the Lawrence family that suffered because of what happened to their son – there are families across Britain who have suffered similar in terms of their children being taken so young.” , Diane and David Rowsell were looking forward to spending more time with the grandchildren. Then they discovered how many of their neighbours in York were going hungry “We fell into it,” says Diane Rowsell, 63, of the community food support project that she and husband David, 64, started in 2020. “It wasn’t like we sat at home thinking: ‘What can we do with our lives now?’” Pre-retirement they were busy: David’s job as a headteacher allowed them to live in the Czech Republic and the US, where Diane, a physiotherapist by training, also worked teaching music; they travelled extensively and adventurously in their free time. Back home in York, they were looking forward to more travel, plus time on their allotment and with their grandchildren. “Just that era of life – busy doing not much!” says Diane. But it doesn’t sound that quiet when she explains that the couple bought a camper van, David was working as a leadership coach, she was taking art classes, and both were volunteering – Diane gardening and David chairing the local school board of governors. Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60? , Alongside the commemorative plates and mugs are some more unusual offerings, from royal ‘pawtraits’ to carriage rides The coronation is rapidly approaching, and with it comes a multitude of companies selling an array of commemorative merchandise to consumers. But alongside what you might expect (a commemorative plate or King Charles mug) are some rather unusual offerings, as some businesses and their PR teams seem to be doing anything possible to mark the day. We’ve done a roundup of the most unexpected coronation merchandise out there, as well as the simply awkward and bizarre. , He was a trail-blazing genius who electrified US ballet. But he was also a dictatorial grudge-bearer who married four of his dancers. How should we remember the Russian-American choreographer? ‘I don’t have a past. I have a continuous present,” said the great Russian-American choreographer George Balanchine, a great believer in forward motion. When Balanchine’s health began to fail, in his mid-70s, he resisted making a will, not thinking that the hundreds of ballets he had created would live on without him. When the IRS posthumously valued his repertory, it decided that the maximum shelf life of even his greatest ballets was just 15 years. Yet today, almost exactly 40 years after Balanchine’s death, his works are as popular as ever. New York City Ballet (NYCB), the company he founded, has just announced its 75th anniversary season, with dozens of performances of his works. Masterful ballets such as Serenade, Symphony in C and Agon are still regularly danced around the world. This summer, the Australian Ballet comes to the UK to perform his Jewels. When Carlos Acosta marks his 50th birthday on stage in July, it is Balanchine’s Apollo that he will dance. , Air pollution and the climate crisis are making pollen even more of a menace. Here’s how to stop your eyes itching and nose streaming If you’ve found yourself reaching for the tissues more than usual recently, you’re not alone. The sun has shown its face a bit, and thanks to the arrival of a tree pollen bomb, which occurs when groups of trees release millions of grains of pollen at the same time, many of us are trading the joys of spring for itchy eyes and streaming noses. According to Margaret Kelman, acting head of clinical services at Allergy UK, the number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years, with the condition now affecting one in four adults in the UK. “Climate change, including increased air pollution, has contributed to more intense pollen seasons,” she says. “Warmer weather speeds up the growing process, causing pollen seasons to start earlier and last longer.” , It’s gripping, nuanced, almost unbearably tense – and it’s about to come to an end. The BBC show’s take on policing post-Troubles Belfast is one of the finest watches of the year When Blue Lights first appeared, it was hard to get too excited about yet another cop show. We are only at the end of April and already the year has been stuffed with them, from the great (Happy Valley) to the functionally decent (Unforgotten) to the fine (Better), you can’t move for a moody detective or a seemingly uncrackable case. One theory about their enduring appeal is that police procedurals are the most psychologically satisfying form of storytelling, because they fulfil what the human brain finds pleasurable about drama – a puzzle to solve, red herrings and false starts, and the idea that somebody knows what’s going on, even if we don’t yet. Written and co-created by Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson (who wrote The Salisbury Poisonings), Blue Lights sets itself apart from the pack. The series – whose final episode airs on BBC One tonight – has a journalistic eye for detail and nuance. It sidesteps the case-of-the-week template, preferring to take an overview of the incredibly complex world of policing in Belfast. This is rich material. First broadcast just before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it paints a detailed picture of the city as it is today, with the Troubles never far from that picture, whether in the highly sensitive issue of policing by consent (and consent is not a given), or in the histories of the men (and women) involved in organised crime. , Scottish-born chef started career in kitchens at the age of 12 before moving to Australia and opening prize-winning restaurants that faltered as mainstream success grew  • Jock Zonfrillo, MasterChef Australia judge and chef, dies aged 46 As a culinary figure, Jock Zonfrillo reached the highest peaks in Australia, his adopted homeland. He won national and international awards, and went on to become a television star with a coveted judging spot on MasterChef. However the life of the chef and television personality, who died on 30 April at age 46, had great lows, both private and public. Zonfrillo, whose legal name is Barry, was raised in Ayr, Scotland. His father, Ivan, was a barber, and his paternal grandparents had migrated to Scotland from Italy, while his mother Sarah’s family were farmers in Scotland. , The site’s success has led to it being accused of swamping tourist hotspots with short-term lets and forcing out locals With its burgeoning, vibrant arts scene, Margate was the perfect base for Dan Thompson, a writer and social activist. But when his landlord came to sell his flat, he was left with nowhere to move to, due to a shortage of properties in the area. One reason, he believes, is that many of the homes are let as short-term rentals on Airbnb. Almost 640 entire homes are let out in the coastal town, according to rental analytics company AirDNA. , We tried and tried, but failed and failed. Yet the fertility industry kept offering us hope, so long as we offered them money Is it possible to become addicted to fertility treatment? When does spending tens of thousands of pounds on IVF with no guarantee that it will actually work become a gambling problem? These are the questions I am searching for answers to as I meet virtually with a doctor from a top London fertility clinic. “Women are a mystery,” he jokes. I smile politely into the tiny camera on my laptop. I had been considering treatment with his clinic and we have spent the last hour running through my history of infertility, or rather, in my case, incomplete fertility. My husband and I have been trying for nine years to have a baby. I’m quite good at getting pregnant, especially when we first started trying, but I can’t seem to stay pregnant. I don’t know why. And as it turns out, neither do the experts. I have spent years seeking their help, and because IVF wasn’t available on the NHS in my area, I have paid thousands of pounds along the way in my relentless pursuit of pregnancy. , The Guardian was right to remove and delete the cartoon published on Saturday, but with all that is known about anti-Jewish symbols and images, this should not be happening Other than his closest friends, it is unlikely that anybody would complain if a Guardian cartoonist drew Boris Johnson as a gorilla. All’s fair in political satire, cartoonists are expected to be scurrilous, and the former prime minister is fair game. But if that same cartoonist drew a black politician in simian form, it would be obviously racist. This is the principle to hold in mind when decoding Martin Rowson’s cartoon of outgoing BBC chair Richard Sharp, who is Jewish, in Saturday’s Guardian. Centuries of anti-Jewish caricaturists (and to be clear, I do not accuse Rowson or the Guardian of falling into this category) have generated an extensive library of visual tropes to convey their hatred of, and disgust for, Jews. This is partly because antisemites face a challenge: how do you incite hatred against a group of people who are not always readily identifiable? Not every Jew wears religious clothing or “looks Jewish” to every beholder. Dr Dave Rich is author of Everyday Hate: How antisemitism is built into our world and how you can change it , There is unease about what happens next. We’re not perfect, but politicians will do anything but address their own shortcomings So, exactly who is making the UK apparently ungovernable? Is it bullying, psychotic ministers intent on stoking the culture wars until Gary Lineker, the BBC, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and every other woke-sucking, electorate-hating public institution is consumed by its righteous flames? Or is it, more specifically, us “over-unionised”, “activist” civil servants – who, despite being a “very small minority” of milquetoast snowflakes, are still somehow capable of orchestrating the ruthless defenestration of Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay and any other poor minister who dares to actually get something – anything – done? , The Harold and Maude actor shows us that spur of the moment acts of generosity can be truly life affirming On the first day directing my first film came my first communication error. I’d asked the costume department to take a man’s shirt (which the lead character had stolen after a one night stand), and fashion it into something she fixes around her cat to stop it picking at its surgical stitches. Expecting it to look like a striped cotton bandage, I was presented with a cat wearing an immaculately tailored miniature button-down. In the end I took it off the cat, but I wish I’d made that work because, when I’ve occasionally daydreamed about the etymology of phrases, I’ve always felt drawn to “the shirt off my back”. At the end of the shoot, my lead, Jemima Kirke, slipped off a diamond and ruby fox ring and handed it to me – the ring off her own finger! I was touched by the gesture and by the echo from a woman I’d cast as “me”: I’d done this same thing myself to friends when I felt they needed moral support, unhooking a bracelet or brooch and pressing it into their palm. It’s never the value of the jewellery that matters as much as the instant decision. Maybe it’s a sense of memory conversation with the ancestors who sewed valuables into their clothes as they fled expulsions, pogroms and ghettoes; letting the past know I feel safe enough in my own life to give my precious things away. I’d say I’ve lost three pieces of jewellery this way, but they’re the opposite of lost. , I have explained what has happened to me, on my own terms, and people have responded in kind I’ve had a double mastectomy. I don’t find it straightforward to spell or to pronounce, but it’s the term I find easiest to use when I tell people what has happened to me. I just can’t put it in plain English, and say exactly what the surgeons did. This may change, but it seems too painful to me, and I worry about the people listening. Generally, since I was diagnosed with breast cancer last summer I have tried to avoid couching things in terms that may be unclear. Years of writing articles on complicated financial products and schemes in my roles on the Guardian’s Money and Investigations desks have conditioned me to avoid jargon. I like to get to the point and use language that is accessible, rather than words that exclude people, and in the main I have taken this approach to my illness. Hilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editor , The president is trying to appeal to climate-conscious young voters and appease the fossil fuel industry. It won’t work Just before announcing that he would again run for president, Joe Biden signed off on what on the surface looks like a great move to help address the climate crisis: an executive order that creates an office of environmental justice in the White House. “Environmental justice,” the president said from the Rose Garden, “will be the mission of the entire government, woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments.” That is a beautiful sentiment. And sentiment, when coupled with substantive policy positions, can lead the country forward. The idea of a White House office that can help mobilize an all-of-government response to the climate crisis could be a force multiplier in the fight to save the planet. But to be effective it needs real presidential leadership that involves the creation of a bold and realistic plan to phase out fossil fuels along a strict timeline. Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer, a Guardian US columnist, and the creator of the Substack newsletter Donziger on Justice , Unsuccessful US college applicants have started having cathartic parties to ‘celebrate’. I think they might be on to something High school students in the US are tackling the brutal process of college applications with rejection parties, the New York Times reported last week. At one school, students bring along a printout of their college rejections, ceremonially feed them into a shredder, then get an ice-cream; there is a prize for the most rejected. It sounds wonderful: a cathartic, collective “screw you” to a broken system, using fun to salve the pain. I wonder if owning rejection is easier in the US, where there is at least a partial sense that failure is OK; it’s considered a learning opportunity and a key part of the origin story. The Silicon Valley motto “fail fast, fail often” took hold because failure was seen as indicative of audacity and a willingness to try. Rejection is a particularly stinging subset of failure, but the principle remains: you took the shot; it didn’t pay off; you try again. , Harry Kane faces big decision, Palace are throwback entertainers and Gary O’Neil shows humility amid success Jack Grealish has stopped falling over. But it’s not just that. Grealish was fouled just twice against Fulham, neither of these the contact-seeking lunges that had for a while become a part of his game. Grealish isn’t necessarily cheating or diving when he does this. The take-the-foul routine is also a way of having your legs battered into a pulp over several years. Grealish carries the ball too well not to be tripped a lot. Contact will happen. Why not manage how that collision works, take the lightest of touches, fall well? But Grealish has started to stay up as well, to use his strength instead to terrorise and bully defenders. He was very good against Fulham, helping to make the opening goal, and just about surviving an ongoing battle with Kenny Tete, who was defending aggressively. Another thing here: the Fulham crowd barracked Grealish and he wagged his finger back at them. But the feeling was less outrage, more pantomime jeers, a kind of semi-buried respect. The other story of Grealish’s season is that he is now surely the most marketable English player in the league; and, grudgingly perhaps for some, one of the most likeable. Barney Ronay Match report: Fulham 1-2 Manchester City Match report: Liverpool 4-3 Tottenham Match report: Manchester United 1-0 Aston Villa , BBC broadcaster is synonymous with the event after more than 20 years as TV’s face of the world snooker championship This year’s World Snooker Championship has produced what some fans of the sport would consider a long overdue wind of change on the baize. Sure, Mark Selby can cement his place in history on bank holiday Monday if he wins the title for a fifth time, but the sight of two players under the age of 30 in Luca Brecel and Si Jiahui playing out a world semi-final felt refreshing if nothing else, given how the sport has been dominated by the same clutch of players for so long. Sports thrive on progression and evolution when it comes to the stars of the show – but away from the action, consistency is a valuable commodity. And for all the change snooker is trying to undergo, there is one bastion of consistency who perhaps never quite gets the credit they truly deserve. In an ever-changing world, nothing screams comforting reassurance like Hazel Irvine presenting the snooker on the BBC. She will utter the first words to the new champion of the world on Monday evening and these days anyone other than Irvine on hand for the biggest moments that matter in snooker feels wrong. , Refreshing response to a question from the media was unlike much of the discourse surrounding elite professional sport Almost certainly fed up while facing the press in the media centre of Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum last Wednesday night, Giannis Antetokounmpo made no attempt to disguise his utter contempt for the query he had just been asked to field. The Bucks basketball legend had fronted up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate after his team’s elimination by the lowly ranked Miami Heat after a five-game series, arguably one of the most seismic upsets in NBA playoff history. Antetokounmpo’s gaze was caught by Eric Nehm, the man from the Athletic on the Bucks beat, who kept his question fairly short and to the point. He had already asked it of Antetokounmpo’s coach and now wished to hear the player’s considered opinion. “Do you view this season as a failure?” A protracted sigh from the top table was followed by an audible groan of “Oh my God”, as Antetokounmpo wearily rubbed his hands up his face and through his hair, in the manner of a man who can’t quite believe the absolute inanity of the question he’s just been asked. Countering with several of his own, rhetorical questions regarding the successes or failures his inquisitor might have enjoyed or endured in his professional life over the past 12 months, he proceeded to expound on his own idea of what constitutes failure, or if there’s even any such thing. “Michael Jordan played 15 years,” he said. “Won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That’s what you’re telling me? I’m asking you a question, yes or no?” , Time will tell who got the best haul of players in Kansas City this year but the already formidable Philly look like they aced the draft once again Philadelphia Eagles. In the past two seasons, the Eagles have given masterclasses in how to execute a perfect draft. The reigning NFC champions have found gold in the south by selecting top-tier players from college football’s best defense. In last year’s draft, the Eagles selected two dominant defensive players, Jordan Davis and Nakobe Dean, both of whom helped the Georgia Bulldogs capture the 2022 national championship. , Project hopes Beatles classic will ‘unite the world’ and show victims of the conflict that they’ll never walk alone An ambitious campaign to create the world’s biggest sing-along as an expression of solidarity with Ukraine during the Eurovision song contest is gaining momentum. The #HelpUkraineSong project is aiming to “unite the world through music” by getting as many people as possible to sing the Beatles’ With a Little Help from My Friends at noon on Saturday 13 May. , Children’s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, urges first minister to put UN protections for under-18s into law Scotland’s outgoing children’s commissioner has warned Humza Yousaf that it will be his “personal failure” if he fails to make good on Nicola Sturgeon’s promise to put international children’s rights standards at the heart of Scottish law. In one of his final interviews before he steps down from the role after six years, Bruce Adamson accused Scottish ministers of “heartbreaking” delays, lack of transparency and “constant broken promises”, after the supreme court ruled that initial attempts at incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law went beyond Holyrood’s powers. , Study of 200,000 Chinese hospital admissions finds acute exposure to air pollution raises risk of heart arrhythmias Spikes in air pollution increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, a large study has found. The research, based on nearly 200,000 hospital admissions in China, found a significant increase in risk of arrhythmias in the first few hours after an increase in air pollution levels. Heart arrhythmias can increase the risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death. , Investors claim sportswear giant failed to minimise their exposure to risk after the rapper and designer’s antisemitic comments led to a sharp decline in the share price Adidas shareholders have filed a class action lawsuit against the sportswear brand, claiming it knew about Kanye West’s problematic behaviour years before it ended their partnership over his antisemitic comments. The shareholders also allege that Adidas failed to mitigate their financial losses or take precautionary measures to minimise their exposure, after the designer and rapper’s erratic behaviour and offensive comments saw him and his Yeezy brand dropped by Adidas, which resulted in a sharp decline in the company’s stock. , Participants who turned in guns were given up to $500 for each firearm at nine program locations throughout the state Thousands of guns were surrendered across New York on Saturday in exchange for gift cards as part of the state’s gun buyback program. According to the New York attorney general, Letitia James, whose office organized the event, more than 3,000 guns including various assault-style rifles and “ghost guns” were given up in what she hailed as a “landmark event”. , Despite the pain of the condition, diagnoses take seven years on average globally. In India, where 42 million women have the disease, cultural stigmas can make the delay even longer ‘Hell-on-earth excruciating pain,” is how Ruhi Singh* describes her experience of endometriosis. Yet it took nearly 20 doctors more than 10 years for her to get a diagnosis. “I got an ultrasound every month where they told me it was all clear and I should ‘do yoga’ or ‘get pregnant’,” says Singh. “I have a bone to pick with all of those doctors.” Her experience is not unusual. Globally, it takes seven years on average to get a diagnosis, even though endometriosis is as common as diabetes, affecting one in 10 women. , Wall Street stalwart to buy ‘all deposits and substantially all assets’ of collapsed bank in deal brokered by federal regulators JP Morgan is to acquire most of the collapsing California bank First Republic, in a takeover brokered by regulators as the US races to contain a rash of bank failures with echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis. After weekend talks brokered by regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. , Santiago Peña of the Colorado party is elected, defeating Efraín Alegre who wanted to switch diplomatic recognition to China Paraguay’s ruling party candidate, Santiago Peña, 44, has scored a big win in the presidential election, tightening the conservative Colorado party’s political grip and defusing fears that diplomatic ties with Taiwan might have been cut. Peña, who has pledged to maintain Paraguay’s longstanding Taiwan relations, had 42.7% of the vote with more than 99% of ballots counted – a more than 15-point lead over centre-left rival Efraín Alegre, who has argued for switching allegiance to China. , Ahead of King Charles III’s coronation, prime minister voices support for separating from monarchy but says it is not a priority New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has said he supports the country becoming a republic but has no immediate plans to act on separation from the monarchy. Hipkins was holding a press conference hours before departing to attend King Charles III’s coronation, when he was asked about the prospect of New Zealand’s independence from the crown. , Reporters say even seemingly innocuous stories are putting them at risk of assault, intimidation and police action under the Digital Security Act Four weeks ago, a reporter in Bangladesh was hauled from his office, badly beaten - and then thrown from the roof of his building, leaving him with fractures in his back, three broken ribs and a machete wound on his head. The journalist, Ayub Meahzi, believes he was targeted for reporting on alleged local government ties to a criminal group. The attack in Chattogram, south-east Bangladesh, has compounded fears of a deterioration in press freedom in the country, which languishes near the bottom of a global press freedom index due to be updated later this week by the group Reporters Sans Frontières. , Over the years, female artists like Georgia O’Keeffe and Hilma af Klint have received scathing reviews. When will women stop being seen as easy targets? In 1993, the reviews for Georgia O’Keeffe’s exhibition at London’s Hayward gallery came in. In the Independent, Andrew Graham-Dixon likened the American artist to a “commercial illustrator” who had “limited talents … but the ambition to be remembered as a Rembrandt”. The Evening Standard’s Brian Sewell said her works were “irredeemably amateur”. William Feaver of the Observer proclaimed that her paintings “made good monthly images on calendars”, while Hilton Kramer’s review in the Sunday Telegraph called her “grossly overrated”, adding that “her great personal beauty played a major role in the myth that now attaches to her name”. Many of these comments are quoted in an article by Beatrix Campbell, published in the Independent in 1993, with the headline: A Woman’s Art That Men Refuse to See. Campbell argued for a more intellectual reading of O’Keeffe – complaining that “national newspaper art critics do not think it necessary to explain or empathise with … or to locate her in the history of American modernism”. This made me think about how so much art criticism is written from a male point of view, and the exceedingly wide gender imbalance that still exists within it. , Our roundup of drama to watch at home includes Panti Bliss’s drag journey, Athol Fugard’s ballroom dreamers and Alain Platel’s nightmarish dance-theatre How very! The sour bubblegum musical inspired by the cult 80s teen movie was filmed during its residency at London’s Other Palace, where they offer karaoke nights and “freeze your brain” cocktails. Make your own slushie and sing along on the sofa as Veronica and JD do some damage. On Icon Film Channel. , The actor’s tale about the creation of a fantasy film captures the humdrum of Hollywood but lacks his on-screen ability to breathe life into characters There is probably a good reason why it is hard to compile a list of decent novels about the making of films (I can think of one, Terry Southern’s Blue Movie): nothing much happens. Or as Tom Hanks observes in this ambitious addition to the genre: “making movies is complicated, maddening, highly technical at times”. Reading it is to be reminded that Hanks, one of the greatest of all movie stars, must have had a good deal of time on his hands during lockdown. Part of its motivation appears to be to give a proper flavour of that truism of movie making: that so much of it is waiting around; three days sitting in a trailer for a minute or two of drama that might end up in a digital suite trash can. This novel, if nothing else, gives you a sense of that experience in real time. Hanks, a famous collector of typewriters, has put them to use once before, in a short story collection that came out in 2017. On that occasion his publisher ventured that “the two-time Oscar winner is as talented a writer as he is an actor”. His screen agent might have had something to say. He writes well enough – there are many artfully constructed scenes here – and what he doesn’t know about the world of this book you’d imagine is not worth knowing; but that quality that he possesses in so much range and depth on screen – the ability to make you care deeply about lives not your own – is quite often elusive on the page. , ...]</td>\n",

In an interview with the Observer before Thursday’s local elections, the Labour leader insists he will more than match Blair for radical ideas on overhauling public services including the NHS. “This will be a bold and reforming Labour government bringing about real change that I hope will be felt through the generations,” Starmer said. , Investigation reveals that at least 440 people appear to have been abandoned in the weeks before the worst Channel disaster in 30 years • Read more: ‘Horror beyond words’: how Channel distress calls were ‘ignored’ Hundreds of vulnerable migrants were abandoned to their fates after the UK coastguard “effectively ignored” reports of small boats in distress during the days leading up to the worst Channel disaster in 30 years when at least 27 people died, an Observer investigation suggests. Around 440 people appear to have been left adrift after the coastguard sent no rescue vessels to 19 reported boats carrying migrants in UK waters, according to an analysis of internal records and marine data seen by the Observer and Liberty Investigates. Experts said the failure to act appears to breach international law. , Nearly 1,900 have been evacuated, says UK government, but final flight has yet to leave Khartoum Britons are feared to have been stranded in Sudan following reports that the country’s armed forces had prevented a number of people from reaching the last rescue flights out of the war-torn country on Saturday. On Saturday night, it was announced that 1,888 people on 21 flights have been evacuated from Sudan – the vast majority of them British nationals and their dependents – but the last flight was yet to leave despite being scheduled to depart at 6pm. , Opinium poll shows slump in personal ratings of Rishi Sunak, with 26% approving of his performance and 44% disapproving Labour’s lead over the Conservatives stands at a commanding 18 points, according to the last Opinium poll for the Observer before a huge set of local elections. With more than 8,000 council seats across 230 authorities in England up for election on Thursday, the Tories had been hoping that polls would tighten as they attempt to avoid heavy losses in both the red wall of old Labour seats and the blue all – south-eastern seats where, traditionally, they have been strong. , MP questions police response that troll who tried to have her children removed was ‘entitled’ to call her an ‘extremist’ The Labour MP Stella Creasy believes police have given online trolls “the green light to target the children of politicians” after she was subject to a baseless complaint to social services. Creasy was investigated by her local council after it received a report from a troll who was trying to have her children taken away from her. , Advice comes despite charity’s warning that social media figure is fuelling shocking growth of misogyny in schools Teachers are being advised by the government not to discuss social media influencer Andrew Tate, the “king of toxic masculinity”, with pupils – despite schools reporting a rising tide of misogyny and sexual harassment from boys as young as nine. One small charity, Diversify, based in Rotherham, which runs school workshops about inclusion, receives about 25 calls a week from primary and secondary schools across England who want help dealing with sexual harassment and “shocking misogynistic incidents”. Many cite the influence of Tate, who is under house arrest in Romania for suspected human trafficking and organised crime. Tate’s TikTok videos tell boys that a woman belongs to her boyfriend; girls who don’t stay at home are “hoes”; and rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks. , Warm weather expected to continue over bank holiday weekend, and sunny day expected for King’s coronation England, Wales and Northern Ireland celebrated the hottest day of the year so far on Saturday, and temperatures were expected to rise further over the bank holiday weekend. The Met Office recorded a high of 20.2C in Pershore, Worcestershire. In Northern Ireland, temperatures peaked at 20C at Castle Derg, while in Wales, 19.2C was recorded in Llysdinam. , British subjects asked to form a ‘chorus of a million voices’ and make oath of loyalty while watching service Members of the public watching the coronation on television, online and in parks and pubs will be invited to swear aloud their allegiance to the monarch in a “chorus of millions of voices” to be known as the Homage of the People. People around the UK and abroad will be invited to say the words “I swear that I will pay true allegiance to your majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God”, in a declaration that replaces the traditional homage of peers. , Campaigners commemorate mammal that drew large crowds in Norwegian capital last summer before being put down A bronze sculpture has been unveiled in Norway of the walrus nicknamed Freya, who gained global attention last summer after basking in the Oslo fjord until officials euthanised her. The lifesize sculpture depicts Freya lying on her side on the rocky shore of Oslo’s Kongen marina, not far from where the real 600kg mammal last summer drew large crowds as she chased ducks and swans, and rested on boats that struggled to support her bulk. , Fire at facility in port of Sevastopol caused no casualties and will not hinder supplies, authorities say  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates At a glance: what we know on day 430 of the invasion A fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, caused by an apparent drone strike, has been extinguished, the Moscow-installed governor has said. . Video footage posted on social media earlier on Saturday showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. More than a dozen fuel tanks are situated at the site in Kozacha Bay. , The discovery of a rare photo from the Spanish civil war raises questions about why volunteers from Australia are not commemorated  Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast The grainy, sepia photograph shows two men, an Australian and a New Zealander. Sydney dock worker Jack Franklyn is partly obscured by bush, leaning forward, his rifle poised and ready. New Zealander Bert Bryan, bare-chested and wearing a beret, crouches at the edge of a trench while shooting at the enemy. They’re in Spain, the battle of Ebro in 1938, and the fact they are fighting together in one of the Spanish civil war’s most seminal and bloody battles lends a gritty new dimension to the revered legend of Anzac. The photograph was recently discovered among personal mementoes in the western Sydney home of 80-year-old Vanessa McNeill. Her father, Wollongong steel worker Jim McNeill fought the fascists alongside Bryan and Franklyn at Ebro, which began 85 years ago this July. McNeill was shot by a machine gun at Ebro, his second wounding in Spain. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads , The silver fox sex icon says he’d rather eat a tangerine than make love. It’s time to reconsider what’s normal in long-term relationships Have we stumbled into an era of sexual ennui? Particularly as we age and couple up, do we increasingly drag our weary, uninspired carcasses to bed, and … nothing? Nada. That’s that. Robbie Williams has been talking about his sex life with Ayda Field, his wife of 13 years. “Everyone knows there is no sex after marriage,” he said, musing that stopping taking testosterone was probably partly responsible for his drop in libido. Williams continued: “Sometimes now, Ayda will turn to me on the sofa and say, ‘We should do sex’, and I’m sitting there eating a tangerine and just sort of shrug.” , Australia forward on adapting to playing overseas and preparing to pack the waterproofs for this year’s Women’s World Cup at home Mary Fowler is becoming accustomed to astonished looks from her Manchester City teammates when she advises those heading to this summer’s World Cup to pack woollens and waterproofs. “A lot of the girls are going to Australia and New Zealand with their countries,” says the Matildas striker. “But most of them expect it to be quite warm, so I’m excited to see how they’re going to react when they realise it’s freezing cold. “Sydney will be chilly but I feel really bad for the girls in New Zealand, the southern hemisphere winter’s going to be freezing there!

The result, after weeks of improv classes and intensive workshops, is several nights of science-inflected live comedy performed around Australia. , The author of Original Sins, an account of addiction and shame, on his book’s impact on his evangelical parents, reading the Patrick Melrose series while waiting for drug dealers, and how looking middle class saved him from arrest Matt Rowland Hill, 38, is the author of Original Sins, about growing up as the son of a baptist minister before falling into a decade-long addiction to heroin while studying at Oxford. Out in paperback, it was longlisted for last year’s Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction while being praised by Geoff Dyer for its “novelistic virtues of vivid scene-making, fully realised characterisation and psychological subtlety”. Hill and I sat in a park near his home in east London. I might have read this as a novel had it not been subtitled “a memoir”.The subtitle wasn’t my choice: I was open to it being published as fiction if my publisher had wanted that. I approached it like a novel, thinking about point of view and how I’d produce moments of irony and humour, which maybe liberated me to write with an emotional distance that paradoxically allowed me to be more honest. Nothing is fabricated. I did go to psychiatric units. I was a heroin addict for all that time. I used my imagination to make vivid the bits of dialogue or details about what we were wearing, although it’s surprising how detailed your recollections are once you dig in; what my father told my mother on that car ride to Guernsey – “If you died tonight, I’d dance on your grave” – was scored into my childhood memory. Original Sins by Matt Rowland Hill is published in paperback on 4 May by Vintage (£10.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

Almost 60,000 fans attended the Red Roses’ 38-33 victory over France and the popularity of the women’s game is expected to increase ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England. “I want to sell out Twickenham,” said England’s victorious captain, Marlie Packer. “I believe we can do it and I believe we can do it before 2025 for the World Cup final. , A brilliant team are demolishing even closest rivals and can make history. But glory lies in drama as well as excellence Manchester City are brilliant. They can win games with and without the ball. They can stifle teams with possession or eviscerate them on the counter. They can produce moments of breathtaking combination play but also have in Erling Haaland a centre-forward with a set of attributes, physical and technical, that has been seen only perhaps half a dozen times before. They are magnificent and seemingly on course for a treble. They are also a symptom of the financial structures that are destroying the game football was once understood to be. The naive and the wilfully blind will say there have been dominant teams before, but not like this there haven’t. Assuming City do go on to win the Premier League, this will be the third time in English history a club have won five titles in six seasons: Liverpool did it between 1979 and 1984 and Manchester United between 1996 and 2001. ,  Verstappen warns Russell after close call at turn three Pérez overtakes Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc for victory in Baku In a season where Max Verstappen and Red Bull already threaten to run away with it, at the Azerbaijan sprint race the Dutchman was handed a salutary reminder that he should not expect an easy ride. Mercedes’ George Russell was the driver to give no quarter, which infuriated Verstappen and caused as feisty an exchange off track as they had with one another on the streets of Baku. It ended with Verstappen warning he would be gunning for Russell in future. The pair’s battle and its ill-tempered fallout was by far the highlight of another somewhat processional sprint, won by Verstappen’s teammate, Sergio Pérez from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, with Verstappen taking third. ,  Leinster 41-22 Toulouse Irish side score four tries while opposition down to 14 men The procession continues. No matter that the visit was of mighty Toulouse, the only club with a richer pedigree in this competition, Leinster march into the final of the Champions Cup as if it were the most natural, obvious cadence to an already stellar season. Whether it is in the green shirts of Ireland or the blue of their province, these players have yet to be beaten this season. Toulouse are not quite so closely a mirror of their national team, but they include France’s best. This might represent a sobering afternoon for more than just France’s most successful club side in this, the year of their home World Cup. , France prop credits Irish coach with transforming the Champions Cup holders but is wary of Exeter before Sunday’s semi-final Uini Atonio is right on time for our Zoom appointment. “I think we’re having lunch soon,” he says with a grin. “I don’t want to be late for that.” The prop’s desire to fuel up is understandable because there is hard work to do. La Rochelle, the Champions Cup holders, stand two victories away from retaining the trophy they won in a dramatic showdown against Leinster last season. Ronan O’Gara’s side meet Exeter on Sunday in the second semi-final, in Bordeaux, for the right to play Leinster in next month’s final in Dublin. La Rochelle have already knocked Saracens and Gloucester out of Europe and are engaged in a tight battle against Toulouse for the French Top 14 title, so it may seem natural to regard them as favourites, particularly in view of Exeter’s mixed domestic form. But that is not how Atonio sees it. , Jürgen Klopp’s £35m signing is starting to score goals and have an influence before Roberto Firmino departs in the summer Cody Gakpo’s first six games as a Liverpool player yielded one victory. He joined a club low on confidence and bereft of form, making the transition from life in the Eredivisie to the Premier League a tougher one than he and the club would have desired. After a six-week trip to the World Cup quarter-finals, Gakpo’s return to domestic football was at a new club in a new country, with the small matter of £35m changing hands. If it has been a confusing season for some due to the World Cup in Qatar breaking up the calendar, Gakpo has had more than most to adapt to but is looking settled as Liverpool prepare to face Tottenham on Sunday. , Has Manchester City’s 4-1 win wrapped up the Premier League? Perhaps not if Mikel Arteta and his players can hang in there Arsenal’s defensive problems in the absence of William Saliba are little secret. They have conceded 2.17 goals a game without the centre-back; with him, that figure reads 0.93. Arguably they have missed Takehiro Tomiyasu in equal measure: he has been injured since mid-March, like Saliba, and could have slotted in at centre-back, taken on bespoke defensive tasks at left-back or, perhaps most attractively, been fielded at right-back to allow Ben White a move inside. , My mother’s contribution to perhaps the most overlooked British folk art of the past 90 years: the canvas-work church kneelerIt’s probably too soon to suggest, as the Rev Richard Coles recently did, that Elizabeth Bingham’s Kneelers is the best non-fiction book of 2023. But, like him, I’m a little in love with this guide to the most practised (and overlooked) British folk art of the past 90 years. Bingham is an authority on Anglican church canvas-work kneelers, and in her lovely book she traces their history from their beginnings in 1930s Winchester, through their zenith after the coronation of Elizabeth II, to the present day, in which a dedicated few keep the tradition alive. Kneelers celebrate and memorialise every aspect of life, not only the religious – though Bible stories do feature, if you’re in the market for a tapestry of Jonah and the whale – and this makes them both touching and surprising. My favourites so far: a grey whippet (St Peter and St Paul, Deddington); a Second World War ARP warden fighting a fire (St Mary Magdalene, Woodstock); Sizewell nuclear power station in the sunshine (St Edmunds, Southwold). , Water pollution, quack! Cost of living crisis, Quack! Strikes, quack! • You can order your own version of this cartoon , Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer’s comedy nails the alchemy of what turns the private into the hilariously relatableI realise this says more about me, but my instinctive response to hearing about a real-life couple doing a comedy show together is usually a rapid sinking of the heart. It’s a scepticism born of too many evenings with coupled-up friends who collapse into spasms of laughter every time someone says “couscous”, and then pretend-apologise by exchanging a special glance and saying: “Sorry, it’s hard to explain, it’s just… we have a thing about couscous.” Yes, hilarious. Frequently, what couples find funny together fails to translate outside that context, and can often feel exclusionary – which, after all, is the point of a private joke: this is our thing, you wouldn’t get it because you weren’t there. So the prospect of that in sitcom form doesn’t inspire confidence. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was a recording of a meeting of the AI in weapons systems select committee of the House of Lords, which was set up to inquire into “how should autonomous weapons be developed, used and regulated”. The particular session I was interested in was the one held on 20 April, during which the committee heard from four expert witnesses – Kenneth Payne, who is professor of strategy at King’s College London; Keith Dear, director of artificial intelligence innovation at the computer company Fujitsu; James Black from the defence and security research group of Rand Europe; and Courtney Bowman, global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering at Palantir UK. An interesting mix, I thought – and so it turned out to be. Autonomous weapons systems are ones that can select and attack a target without human intervention. It is believed (and not just by their boosters) that these systems could revolutionise warfare, and may be faster, more accurate and more resilient than existing weapons systems. And that they could, conceivably, even limit the casualties of war (though I’ll believe that when I see it). , Conservationists in the Brazilian Amazon are using a new tool to predict the next sites of deforestation – and it may prove a gamechanger in the war on logging It took just the month of March this year to fell an area of forest in Triunfo do Xingu equivalent to 700 football pitches. At more than 16,000 sq km, this Environmental Protection Area (APA) in the south-eastern corner of the Brazilian Amazon, in the state of Pará, is one of the largest conservation areas in the world. And according to a new tool that predicts where deforestation will happen next, it’s also the APA at highest risk of even more destruction. The tool, PrevisIA, is an artificial intelligence platform created by researchers at environmental nonprofit Imazon. Instead of trying to repair damage done by deforestation after the fact, they wanted to find a way to prevent it from happening at all. , National Crime Agency assessing risk after data of some National Smallbore Rifle Association members ‘compromised’ Police are investigating a cyber-attack involving potentially thousands of British gun owners, raising concerns that organised criminals may target them for firearms. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is assessing the level of risk after the National Smallbore Rifle Association (NSRA) confirmed that data belonging to some of its members had been “compromised”. ,  68-year-old presenter to step down at the end of season ‘It is now the right time to move on.

It is not the first time the 68-year-old has announced he would stepping down but Stelling has promised he will not change his mind on this occasion. Stelling previously claimed he would leave Sky Sports at the end of last season but decided to stay on for another year. , White House announces offenders to be moved to home confinement and they will not have to pay remainder of fines President Joe Biden has ordered the federal prison sentences of 31 people to be reduced, punishments which were given to them after nonviolent drug-related convictions. In an announcement released on Friday, the White House revealed that those whose sentences were commuted would be under home confinement until a 30 June expiration date for their respective punishments. The plan is for them to then be on supervised release, with the duration of that based on their original sentence. , Health ministry gives green light for two-step treatment to end pregnancies up to nine weeks The abortion pill is to become available in Japan for the first time after the health ministry approved a drug used to terminate early-stage pregnancies. Abortion is legal in Japan up to 22 weeks, but consent is usually required from a spouse or partner, and until now a surgical procedure had been the only option. , Police are searching for suspect in after shooting in Cleveland, in which one of the victims was an eight-year-old child After neighbors complained about the noise he was making, a Texas man went next door with an AR-15-style rifle and shot them, killing five people – including an eight-year-old child – as well as wounding three others at a home in Cleveland, Texas, on Friday night. Law enforcement patrolling the community more than 40 miles outside of Houston were searching for Francisco Oropeza, 38, who had been intoxicated and fled the scene, the sheriff of San Jacinto county, Greg Capers, told reporters on Saturday. , The Juan Fernández fur seal, once thought extinct, can ingest cadmium without ill effects – though no one knows how A creature that humans came very close to obliterating now offers hope that we may be able to find ways to tackle one of the most pernicious environmental poisons, say scientists.

Chiles, as a Guardian columnist, is perennially baffled by life: bewilderment is his USP. On the radio he umms and errs through the questions of the day: football, the joys of weeds, etc. But not-quite-understanding can be useful in a broadcaster, and on Tuesday morning, Chiles used his furrowed-brow interview technique to excellent effect, resulting in a thoroughly edifying listen. , Throughout her 20s, Eloise Snape was a chronic relationship-phobe.

And what about TikTok? We look at ways a conflict might inflict yet more harm on our struggling businesses  As the world struggles with the economic fallout from the Ukraine war, fears are mounting about a conflict that would be even more consequential: a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Last week, Taiwan’s foreign minister said he was preparing for the possibility of a conflict with China in 2027, and a leaked memo from a four-star US general said his “gut” told him the US – which is committed to defending Taiwan – would be at war with China in 2025. , Since 2017, Colorado-based painter Remington Robinson has been painting outdoor scenes on the inside lids of Altoids tins.

I hope we can win the game but I have to say Roy has done a fantastic job. We are in a position that we would rather not be and we have to keep picking up points.

A win for the Spiders will take them above Dundee, who could only draw with relegation-threatened Cove Rangers at Dens last night, and ensure that a draw in their final game - at home to Dundee - will mean the league title and promotion to the Scottish Premier. Even defeat to Morton, who themselves are still in with a chance of making the play-offs, will set things up for a winner takes all match between the top two next week. It’s also the first leg of the play-off between The Spartans and Brechin, Lowland and Highland league winners respectively, to see who will go forward to play for a place in the Scottish League against the team finishing at the bottom of Scottish League Two (currently Albion Rovers). So all to play for. They don’t call it the business end of the season for nothing, I suppose.” … so the Premier League table now looks like this, for the next couple of hours anyway. If Palace had any lingering relegation fears, they’re conclusively gone now. Mr Roy’s done quite the job there. West Ham will still be looking over their shoulder, and though their run-in isn’t the easiest, with games against both Manchester clubs and trips to Brentford and Leicester coming up, the fact they’re not shy of scoring goals should see them all right: they’ve now scored 14 in their last five matches. ,  Day three from the latest round of the County Championship Sign up for The Spin | And mail Tanya, tweet her or post BTL I think we can safely now say that Ben Compton is not a one-season wonder.

Brighton have made a raft of changes, their squad knackered and dejected after defeats in the FA Cup semi-final and away at Nottingham Forest. Alexis Mac Allister, Kaoru Mitoma, Moises Caicedo, Levi Colwill and Facundo Buonanotte all start on the bench, with Danny Welbeck, Adam Webster, Joel Veltman, Deniz Undav and the lesser-spotted Billy Gilmour stepping up. Wolves just make two tweaks to the side that started the 2-0 won over Crystal Palace during the week: Joao Gomes and Pedro Neto step up, Hwang Hee-Chan and Matheus Cunha step down. Brentford, on a high after winning at Chelsea, switch things around a bit too. Aaron Hickey, Mikkel Damsgaard, Kevin Schade and Bryan Mbeumo replace Mads Roerslev, Mathias Jorgensen, Frank Onyeka and Yoane Wissa.

Half the venue, it seems, raise theirs. Even Williams looks taken aback. She shouldn’t be surprised. The US band’s last appearance here was five years ago; against the odds, a new generation of Paramore fans has come on stream. This has been the much-maligned 00s pop-punk pioneers’ fastest-selling tour ever.

From a penknife to a DVD, here are the stories of six items that couldn’t just be chucked out Gwynne (left), now 38 and a producer in New YorkWe met in 2007, when we were both living in New York. I had just moved from Kansas and Paul was a friend of a friend of my sister’s, who I was living with at the time. He was a Brit, working for a totally shady company that went door to door around all the pharmacies in New York City. He lived in an apartment that the company rented for him and three other guys, who spent their days going between pharmacies. Paul would come to New York on a travel visa, for three months at a time, then fly back to England for a bit, then return. We dated for a year. He was the most wonderful human being; everybody loved him and wanted to take him under their wing. He just had a way of winning them over; not in a scammy way – he was just really likable.

       "      <td>[A strike that killed 23 people far from any frontlines has forced residents to understand that one could come anywhere  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates Huddled under a blanket, Iryna Babii turned away from the empty space where, until Friday, nine floors of apartments had been stacked, one of them home to her daughter’s best friend. The apartments were obliterated when a Russian missile crashed into this residential block, which sits beside a school in a neighbourhood just near the botanical gardens of Uman, a central Ukrainian city that before the war was known mostly as a Jewish pilgrimage site. , People turn to handouts and pawning goods as Kyiv’s bustling bars belie reality of life in wartime for many In the Treasure pawn shop in Kyiv, Oleksandra, 40, a well turned out woman in a hooded wool coat and Nike trainers, has come to redeem her sewing machines. Like all those visiting the store, she does not want to give her family name. She says that when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, she was working as an accountant for a firm that employed 14 people, who were all laid off because of the conflict. Since then she has struggled to find regular work. With savings running out, like many others in Kyiv, she turned to pawning her possessions to get by, only finding a job a year later that allowed her to claim back her machines. , High-ranking government members hope to make political capital out of their own failures. Labour must reject this cynicism In a fortnight’s time, a remarkable two-day political conference is going to be happening in central London. The people speaking in its debates and discussions come almost entirely from the political right: they will include the home secretary, Suella Braverman, her cabinet colleague Michael Gove, and a host of voices from media outlets such as the Daily Telegraph and GB News. What will sit at the heart of proceedings, says the event’s official blurb, are “the idea of the nation” and “the revival of the unique national traditions that alone have the power to bind a people together and bring about their flourishing”. The foes and bugbears that will be decried include “political theories grounded in race”, and “a powerful new Marxism”. , UK policy is to ensure its industry doesn’t suffer collateral damage in the contest for tech supremacy Rishi Sunak is readying a billion pounds to subsidise the UK’s fledgling microchip industry. It sounds big. But the British government is merely reacting to US economic warfare against China. Behind the talk of “friendshoring” and resurgent industrial policy is a struggle to avoid collateral damage in the battle between China and the US for tech supremacy. The EU plans almost to match the US promise of $52bn (£42bn) in chip subsidies. India is spending $30bn (£25bn) on its semiconductor mission. Mr Sunak looks to be bringing a peashooter to a gunfight. But Britain does not have a complete end-to-end chip supply chain nor does it aspire to have one. Instead, it is following the slipstream of US power. Washington’s strength is that almost all chip factories contain critical tools from US suppliers. The US has isolated Beijing with export control powers that ban transactions between foreign countries and China. Washington’s legislative arsenal was first deployed against China’s Huawei, whose products Britain has also decided to ban. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More will be needed Social security is an investment in people, yet politicians in England have often treated it as a handout that should be almost impossible to survive on. The Scottish government has taken a different attitude. In place of George Osborne’s two-child limit on benefits, it has established a new weekly payment of £25 for each child. To mitigate the bedroom tax, it introduced discretionary housing payments. While the Department for Work and Pensions rolled out huge changes to benefits without consulting those who use them, Scotland commissioned “experience panels” to involve people in the design of policies. Despite these laudable attempts to ease the pain of Westminster’s swingeing cuts, the longer story of poverty in Scotland is one of bleak contradictions. As new research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) shows, while overall poverty levels have fallen, the number of people in very deep poverty has grown dramatically. Over the past two decades, a population the size of Dundee has been pushed into extreme poverty (households with less than 40% of the median income). People in this group are more likely to be single adults, from minority ethnic backgrounds, or disabled. Many of the causes – such as low-paid jobs – are national phenomena. Destitution is rising across Britain. But its increase in Scotland should also be a warning about how policies are targeted. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was not established primarily or directly to improve schools or the system generally. It aimed to provide impartial, independent, professionally subjective judgments to assist leaders, governors and teachers in evaluating their policies and provision so as to help determine priorities for development. It was for schools to consider the inspection findings and commendations, not to necessarily accept them all. That original limited but valuable purpose has been forgotten, even corrupted, and overtaken by more grandiose claims. Ofsted is now viewed by its leaders and supporters as providing authoritative, “objective”, incontestable findings and recommendations that have to be acted on. Its detractors contest these claims as unwarranted and overblown. Any reform of the system would do well to recognise the value of the limited purposes set out in the original legislation.Prof Colin RichardsFormer HM inspector of schools, Spark Bridge, Cumbria , Readers say Conservative candidates appear to be distancing themselves from the governing party Alison Hallum and Brian Sandall (Letters, 25 April and 26 April) might be interested to know that Conservatives are also disappearing in Milton Keynes. None of their leaflets mention the party, and they’re on the nomination list as “Local Conservatives”. This is a clear attempt at distancing themselves from the governing party, though it appears well-coordinated by campaign headquarters. Friends tell me they are seeing similar in many other areas.Paul Norris Olney, Buckinghamshire • In our Tory stronghold we have had no posters or literature from the party. We note from our local paper, the Hereford Times, that they are styling themselves as “Local Conservatives”. Have they even here despaired of their own government?Margaret and Les BarclayLeominster, Herefordshire ,  Klopp: ‘I really don’t know what Tierney has against us’ Spurs’ Ryan Mason feels Diogo Jota deserved red card Jürgen Klopp accused the referee Paul Tierney of holding a grudge against Liverpool and of speaking out of turn during his team’s thrilling stoppage‑time victory over Tottenham. Klopp was booked by Tierney for sprinting up to the face of fourth official John Brooks when celebrating Diogo Jota’s 94th‑minute winner at Anfield, which came 99 seconds after Richarlison appeared to have completed Spurs’ comeback from three goals down. ,  ‘It’s a big disaster, a crazy moment’ says shaken Ocon Pérez holds off Verstappen in Red Bull one-two “Expect the unexpected”, proclaimed the banners adorning the streets of Baku for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. An entreaty that proved to be wishful thinking at best for all but the final moments of the race, when a near-disaster in the form of an astonishingly dangerous incident proved as entirely unanticipated as it was unwelcome. Sergio Pérez might have taken the win for Red Bull but the meeting was marked by the sight of personnel gathered in the pit lane scattering in panic as Esteban Ocon’s car bore down on them, putting Formula One and the FIA’s safety procedures under enormous scrutiny. , Fulham did expose one weakness but Pep Guardiola’s relentless side shrugged it off to go top of the Premier League Tick. Tick. Tick. At the end of this breezy, fun, quietly feisty 2-1 defeat of Fulham, there was even a sense of super-smart design in Pep Guardiola’s onfield displays of affection. There was a double-hug for John Stones: both hands around the torso plus a final flurry of buttock pats for the key defensive peg on the current eight-match winning league run. Guardiola hugged Jack Grealish, just because he loves hugging Jack Grealish. ,  Semi-final: La Rochelle 47-28 Exeter Holders score seven tries to reach third successive final So much for Exeter’s Last Dance. This was a waltz for La Rochelle, a walloping for the Chiefs. They had hoped to wave goodbye to so many departing club stalwarts in style this season but the brutal reality is they were steamrollered by a La Rochelle side who blend power and panache to devastating effect and are now into their third successive Champions Cup final. Grégory Alldritt produced the kind of performance that made him Europe’s premier back-rower not so long ago but La Rochelle’s dominance was all over the pitch – the outside centre UJ Seuteni particularly catching the eye – as they ran in seven tries. , Institute of Directors index returns to levels last seen just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 Business confidence has increased for the fifth month in a row, according to a regular health-check by bosses’ lobby group the Institute of Directors. The IoD’s “economic confidence index”, which surveys company directors on issues such as the wider economy and their own plans for hiring and investment, rose to -5 in April, up from -13 the previous month. , Complexity of system and perception of government handouts as ‘shameful’ stopping people from accessing much-needed support Millions of UK households are collectively missing out on at least £19bn a year in unclaimed welfare benefits, at a time when many are forced to use food banks or run up debt as they struggle with rising living costs, according to new estimates. Lower income households are failing to claim benefits and other cash support for which they are eligible, according to a study by the consultancy Policy in Practice. Some families could be forgoing as much as £4,000 a year. , Tax Justice Network says monarch can lead push to revamp laws allowing ‘industrial scale avoidance’ totalling £152bn a year King Charles has been urged to call for the breakup of the “UK’s network of satellite tax havens” through which an estimated £152bn worth of tax is avoided every year, according to campaigners. Tax Justice Network, a coalition of researchers and activists campaigning against tax avoidance, are today calling on King Charles to use his reign as monarch to call for a revamp of laws that allow industrial scale tax avoidance in the UK, the crown dependencies and the British overseas territories. , Invoice for ex-PM’s time at Kent mansion when foreign secretary is thought to include sums for missing bathrobes and party business Liz Truss is disputing part of a £12,000 bill sent to her by the Cabinet Office relating to her use of the grace-and-favour Chevening house while she was foreign secretary. The bill mostly covered hospitality but also included missing items, such as some bathrobes, and dates back to last summer when she was fighting the Conservative leadership campaign against Rishi Sunak. , Nurses union head clashes with Steve Barclay over plans to protect patients and RMT rows with Mark Harper about striking on eve of Eurovision final The Royal College of Nursing has clashed with the government over whether sufficient exemptions have been made to protect patient safety during the nurses’ strike in England that started on Sunday evening. The clash came as a row erupted between the leader of the train drivers’ union and the transport secretary, who had criticised a planned strike on the eve of the Eurovision song contest final for its impact on Ukraine. , Opposition leader says party would change current system, in which PM has final say on who gets job Keir Starmer has said Labour would make sure the BBC chair is independently appointed after Richard Sharp’s resignation following his failure to declare that he had helped Boris Johnson get a loan. The Labour leader suggested the party would reform the system, in which the prime minister currently has the final say on who gets the job. , Local man aged 24 arrested in Bodmin on multiple charges following knife attack A man has died and seven others were left injured after a stabbing near a nightclub in Cornwall. Police were called to Castle Canyke Road in the Victoria Square area in Bodmin at 3.15am on Sunday after reports of a person with a knife and multiple people with suspected stab wounds. , Boat with 38 people onboard got into difficulty in Channel and left to drift back towards France, FOI request shows A boat carrying 38 people, including children, that got into difficulty crossing the Channel was not rescued when it reached UK waters but was instead allowed to drift back towards France, according to internal maritime logs. Ministry of Defence officials, who were managing small boats in the Channel at the time, told the Guardian in January that they disputed that the stricken dinghy had entered UK waters. , FBI says it has ‘zero leads’ after two days of searching for suspect in fatal shooting of neighbors after noise complaint The man suspected of killing five people, including a nine-year-old boy, with an AR-15-style weapon after neighbors asked him to stop shooting in his yard could be anywhere by now, authorities in Houston, Texas, have said. More than 200 police from multiple jurisdictions were involved in the search for 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza as the FBI acknowledged it had “zero leads” nearly two days after the shooting occurred near the town of Cleveland, about 45 miles north of Houston. Authorities put up $80,000 in reward money for information about his whereabouts. A previous version of this story, based on information from the FBI, incorrectly stated the age of Daniel Enrique Laso as eight years old. His father said the boy was nine. , Hospitals, morgues and burial grounds under pressure, with more than 300 bodies found this year in just one region Authorities in Tunisia are considering building new cemeteries, as the country runs out of space to bury the dozens of refugees washing up every day on its shores. The first three months of 2023 were the deadliest for people attempting to cross the central Mediterranean since 2017, according to the UN, with an increasing number of boats carrying asylum seekers wrecked at sea. , According to the comedian’s hilarious new show, the royals are a crime syndicate we should throw molotov cocktails at – or replace with a constitution. That’s how you tell truth to power! ‘You’d think Prince Andrew would apologise,” says Frankie Boyle. He’s midway through his timely lament about what he takes to be the misogynistic, thick, inegalitarian non-entities of Britain’s monarchy, shortly before the fatuous institution’s continued existence is solemnised with Charles III’s coronation. “I apologise after consensual sex.” And yet, for all the Glaswegian comedian’s republican posturing, there is a queasy sense that if Prince Andrew didn’t exist, Boyle would have to invent him. The Duke of York is the comedy gift that keeps giving. Symbols are important to the royal brand, Boyle tells us. Consider Prince Charles’s crest before he became King. It “shows a lion mounting another lion while a horse looks patiently on. Whereas the Duke of York’s shows a lion paying £12m to a sex-trafficked lion cub the lion claims he never met.” , A powerful new weight-loss medication may be approved for those aged 12 to 17. But healthcare professionals fear it ignores the underlying socioeconomic causes Like many GPs around the UK, Semiya Aziz has grown accustomed to seeing children as young as four or five who are obese. Knowing how best to address this delicate and complex issue with parents, given the time constraints of a 10-minute consultation, is a challenge for GPs, who are increasingly shouldering the burden of the UK’s burgeoning child obesity crisis. “It’s very difficult to actually say, ‘Look, your child is overweight and needs to go on a programme,’” says Aziz, whose practice is in Palmers Green, north London. “There’s a big taboo with discussing it, as parents don’t want to upset their children. And GPs don’t have time in a short consultation to get those educational measures about healthy lifestyles across and delve into the child’s habits.” , UK Ministry of Defence reports that Russian commanders have likely started punishing discipline breaches by detaining troops in ‘Zindans’ Shelling through the night in the city of Kherson has injured two people, deputy head of Kherson Oblast Council Yuriy Sobolevsky said this morning. More than 27 attacks were reported on residential areas of the wider Kherson region on Saturday, according to its authorities, with some 135 shells fired. ,  Nepo and Liren play four 25+10 games to decide champion Tweet Bryan at @BryanAGraham or email him The eval bar goes back to dead even after Ding’s 23.

The government announced mission accomplished last week on its manifesto commitment to recruit 20,000 extra coppers. Labour hit back, saying this was just reversing the government’s own cuts since 2010. The reality is somewhere in between: there has now been an increase in police numbers since 2010, but we’re talking 3,500, not 20,000, and forces have grown more slowly than the populations they police. , Kiln; Almeida; Dorfman, LondonIn his quickfire new McCarthy-era play, For Black Boys… creator Ryan Calais Cameron speaks his mind; a civil rights musical buzzes with potential; and Deborah Bruce’s domestic abuse drama is full of surprises I have always assumed that one chief sign of a strong dramatist was instant recognisability. Yet Ryan Calais Cameron is proving his talent by showing how elastic it is. His astonishing For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy, now wowing the West End, is intense, inward – and danced as much as spoken. His new play is utterly different: socially engaged, skilfully recreating a historic encounter and driven by rapid-fire dialogue. Opening in the week of Harry Belafonte’s death, Amit Sharma’s fleet production of Retrograde strikes with particular force. Set in the 50s, the action draws on the real-life hounding of black actors during the McCarthyite era, in particular the pressure – essentially, do this or you won’t work – put on Sidney Poitier to denounce the glorious singer, actor and campaigner Paul Robeson. , Fresh vibrant flavours to welcome the spring into your kitchen The words, chalked in upper case on a grey board, greet me from afar: CARLINGFORD OYSTERS. CORNISH MACKEREL. For once, my mind is made up even before I set foot in the shop. I glance at some tempting sea bass and a bag of tiny mussels, shells closed tight, but I go with the recommendation. You learn to trust your local shopkeepers. I do almost nothing with the oysters save a tiny squeeze of lemon. They have a briny, slap-you-in-the-face freshness and set us up for a fish supper of grilled mackerel with cider vinegar and paprika, and a plume of grilled spring onions. I sometimes struggle to get mackerel off the bars of the griddle, so decide to cook it with heat from above, under the oven grill. The fillets are turned halfway through, to crisp the skin, something I relish, even if others don’t. , UK Ministry of Defence reports that Russian commanders have likely started punishing discipline breaches by detaining troops in ‘Zindans’ Shelling through the night in the city of Kherson has injured two people, deputy head of Kherson Oblast Council Yuriy Sobolevsky said this morning.

Specifically, his two primary options of Qa4 or g5. , The home secretary is emboldening the far right by pointing the finger at ethnic groupsIn a recent Spectator column, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, claimed that by highlighting the Pakistani ethnicity of grooming gang members in a “string of cases”, she was merely pointing out “unfashionable facts”. Yet why zero in on a string of cases that received extensive media coverage, rather than acknowledging the full scale of the problem based on the data we have about all such cases? To learn that half a million British children are sexually abused each year should drive us to anger and action. We are right to want to know how to tackle a problem taking place on such a vast national scale. But we cannot tackle a problem if we fail to truly see what that problem is. And that means seeing it through the lens of fact. , Conservative candidates in this week’s polls include several who were reinstated after accusations of racism and Islamophobia Five Conservative councillors standing for the party in this week’s local elections in England, have been suspended for alleged racism and Islamophobia in recent years – including one who suggested banning mosques and another who accused Muslims of being on a “quest to turn the world Muslim”. They are among 13 councillors identified by the Observer, drawing on research by the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, who have been suspended over racist comments and social media posts in the past four years before being reinstated. , Last flight left on Saturday night following evacuation of nearly 1,900 people and amid concerns Sudan’s army had blocked some from leaving The final UK flight taking evacuees from Sudan left on Saturday night, the UK government has said, marking the end of Britain’s evacuation operation from the country stricken by warring armed forces. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the last flight left Wadi Saeedna airfield, just north of the capital, Khartoum, at 10pm local time and that the UK is no longer running evacuation flights from the airfield. , Top gardeners advise use of tougher varieties that can cope with extremes of heat and cold as conditions disappoint growers Gardeners are being urged to grow plants that can cope with extreme heat and cold after the Royal Horticultural Society was bombarded with letters from members asking why species they had cultivated successfully for years were now dying. “It seems to be because of the temperature fluctuations,” said Nikki Barker, a senior horticultural adviser at the RHS. “We’ve gone from severe drought with an initially very mild autumn that turned cold. It’s the combination of weather patterns rather than one single event. And plants find it hard to deal with that fluctuation.” , Staff warn vulnerable children may be harmed as they struggle to find placements after 28 homes given deadline to shut by chain One of the UK’s largest for-profit care chains has been accused of failing dozens of vulnerable children by shutting 28 residential homes, with staff warning they are struggling to find placements for all the children. Outcomes First Group, which is owned by private equity firm Stirling Square, is planning to close a string of children’s homes across the Midlands and southern England by 5 May. The homes are understood to accommodate more than 60 children, placed in the care of the private group by councils including Bristol, Cheshire and Enfield in London. , With concern among allies seemingly growing, there is a lot riding on an imminent counter-assault on the Russians in the south  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates The last time “Luh” served in the military, he was a Soviet conscript, sailing the Arctic Ocean with the USSR’s northern fleet over four decades ago. When Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed proxies moved into his home region of Luhansk nearly a decade ago, he cheered on the Ukrainian army but thought his fighting days were behind him. , Coastguard agency says fire was extinguished and all 60 passengers were evacuated safe and well Passengers on a ferry to Orkney had to be evacuated and taken ashore by lifeboat after the vessel ran aground in what was described as “a major incident”. All 60 passengers, including three children and a baby, were said to be safe and well after the incident in Scapa Flow on Saturday evening. , President says island is only receiving two-thirds of the petrol it needs as queues outside gas stations stretch miles There was a time when International Workers’ Day was marked in Cuba by parades involving millions of people marching through Havana’s Revolution Square. Many came out of conviction, some because they were pressured, others to enjoy the party. This Monday, however, the square will be empty, after the Cuban Communist party cancelled this year’s celebrations due to gasoline shortages that are crippling the island’s economy. , Consumers are being ‘misled’ into believing dairy cattle graze in fields, says  animal rights campaign Some of the UK’s biggest food firms are accused of misleading consumers after buying their milk from intensive industrial dairy units despite using images to promote their products that show cows grazing in green fields. Tens of thousands of dairy cattle in England are kept in hangar-style sheds with no or very limited access to pasture. They will typically be milked three times daily, often on large electronic rotating milk parlours, producing up to 32 litres of milk each day. , Department of Health asks watchdog to assess effectiveness of giving semaglutide to obese youngsters aged 12 to 17 Children as young as 12 in England could be given weight-loss injections on the NHS after the government asked medical watchdog Nice to assess the potential benefits of prescribing them to under-18s. Department of Health officials have asked the watchdog to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of giving semaglutide injections to obese children aged 12 to 17, “in addition to healthy nutrition and increased physical activity”, the Observer can reveal. , The symbol of antisocial behaviour is back in the limelight as one London borough outlaws it It’s not hard to spot a hoodie in Romford in east London – hooded tops have become almost as ubiquitous as jeans around the UK. So a new rule banning anyone from putting up their hoods in the town centre’s shopping areas has not gone down well with some. “It’s the most stupid thing I’ve ever heard in my life,” says Mohamed Amraoui, a 24-year-old prison officer. , UK Ministry of Defence reports that Russian commanders have likely started punishing discipline breaches by detaining troops in ‘Zindans’ There have been reports of heavy shelling in the Kharkiv region this morning. Several homes in the city of Kupyansk have been hit with anti-aircraft missiles, according to local officials. The hit caused fires at residential houses and garages and four cars were destroyed, but there were no casualties, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration. , US president says he is ‘working like hell’ to secure release of Wall Street Journal reporter held in Russia on espionage charges Joe Biden has praised the “absolute courage” of Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges, and reiterated calls on Moscow for his immediate release. The US president said the Wall Street Journal reporter, who is the first correspondent since the cold war to be detained in Russia on spying charges, sought to “shed light on the darkness” of the country and said American efforts to get him home would not cease. , Crimea navy oil depot fire extinguished after reported Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks; Nancy Pelosi speaks about her ‘dangerous’ Kyiv visit  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage , At 24, Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold has the world at his feet. But many thousands make the same sacrifices only to be dropped at the last moment – sometimes with tragic consequences. Here, he reveals why he’s working to support ex-academy players Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to make clear he has absolutely no regrets about his path to the Premier League. He’s about to recount memories of extreme pressure and major sacrifice. And, really, he’s not complaining. “I’m a success story,” he says, in a soft scouse accent, not boastful. “I look back and I’m proud. I got here through hard work and discipline.” At 24, he has already banked a lifetime of financial and vocational achievements. But he is a rare exception. And for the past few years, that fact has been troubling him. Like the vast majority of top-flight professional players in the UK and beyond, Alexander-Arnold came up through a football academy. Across the country, around 12,000 boys aged eight and up are enrolled in these training schemes (boys and girls can start training with clubs from as young as five years old). Professional clubs scout young players and help them develop towards the adult game. Around 3,500 boys are currently signed to Premier League academies, but over 99% of children signed to an academy aged nine won’t have a professional footballing career. “There were players who were faster and stronger than me who didn’t make it,” Alexander-Arnold tells. “I’m not moaning about it. I’m not saying I don’t deserve it. But I played with hundreds of kids growing up. Against thousands. What would have happened if it hadn’t worked out for me?” , This family-run Greek restaurant serves up so much more than just classic dishes Alexandros Greek Restaurant &amp;amp; Deli, 68 Warwick Road, Carlisle CA1 1DR (01228 592227). Starters £5.75-£9.95, mains £14.50-£28.50, desserts £7.50, wines from £21 Lots of restaurants can be full on a Thursday and Friday night. Lots of restaurants can smash it on a Saturday. That’s not how you make a living. To make a living, you have to be full on a Wednesday lunchtime. This Wednesday lunchtime, Alexandros is doing trade of which others can only dream. “It was even busier yesterday,” says Aris Pathanoglou, who owns the place with his wife, Sarah, when I comment on the bustle and hum. It’s an older crowd, the sort who can find space on a weekday for a proper lunch, as long as it’s reliable, and yes, we will have a whole bottle, thanks. Alexandros, a venerable Greek restaurant, which has been feeding the good and greedy of Carlisle for more than two decades, is clearly very reliable. , The distinguished historian and headteacher discusses his latest book about a contemporary prime minister, a devastating – and dispiriting – account of Johnson’s chaotic reign  Andrew Rawnsley reviews Johnson at 10 by Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell Sir Anthony Seldon, the famous headteacher, has been writing book-length report cards on British prime ministers for 40 years. The latest, on Boris Johnson, based on the accounts of more than 200 people who witnessed his catastrophic, clown-car time in office first-hand, is a test not only of Seldon’s method, but also his tone. In previous volumes the author has assumed a base level of gravitas in his subjects, and of structure in their government. Though he employs the same quasi-legal model for his inquiry here, gathering careful evidence, weighing judgments, the story he pieces together is often one of venal mayhem; it frequently reads like a considered constitutional appraisal of rats in a sack. There is a telling coincidence in the fact that the first indelible report of Johnson’s behaviour was also the work of a school master. Martin Hammond’s infamous notes on Johnson at Eton, which recorded his “disgracefully cavalier attitude”, his “gross failure of responsibility” and his deep-seated belief that he “should be free of the network of obligation that binds everyone else” is the opening source of Seldon’s account. Johnson’s “end was in his beginning”, he argues. Speaking to me about his book last week, Seldon noted that Hammond – who had been the “formidable pipe-smoking” head at Tonbridge school when he started out as a teacher – was a longstanding inspiration, both as an educator and a writer. “Two things,” he says. “One is that his report was typically acute and detailed, like a psychiatrist’s analysis. And second: just how much the character is formed very early on.” , On his wedding day, Tim Sullivan’s much-loved dad suddenly collapsed and died on what should have been the happiest of days. But what he learned has shaped his life It was all set to be one of the happiest days of my life, 9 September 1989. I was getting married. Everything leading up to the date had gone smoothly. The wedding was taking place in a small church, St Teilo’s in Bishopston Valley on the Gower peninsula. About 130 friends and family had made the trip down to South Wales. After the ceremony, Rachel and I were going to process up the hill from the church to the reception at my in-laws’ home, led by a small jazz band and followed by our guests. But as we left the church, my father suddenly collapsed and died in my arms. He was 65, exactly the age I am now as I write this. It’s a moment I remember vividly. A moment that affected what I went on to write about in my career and how I wrote it. A moment that demonstrated how tragic things have a habit of occurring at the happiest and most unexpected of times. , The 80-year-old US president chooses annual address to have some fun with a crucial voter concern, mixed with digs at Don Lemon and Fox News Age shall not weary him, but it might provide some good punchlines. Joe Biden, the oldest president in American history, faced his biggest political liability with a smile on Saturday as he addressed a gathering of Washington’s political and media elites. , Punk rock exploded in 1977 with a raw power seldom seen since. But Johnny Rotten (as he used to call himself) is 67 now, and most of his fans from that time are in their 60s. So what became of all that energy, spiky hair and safety-pins? Mark Jordan enjoys walking around his Welsh home town “got up like a Christmas tree” in vintage Vivienne Westwood bondage shirts and bright blue brothel creepers. “The other day, I was stopped by this young guy walking the dog, he was wide-eyed and said, ‘What is that you’re wearing?’” Jordan says. “His eyes were on sticks when I told him that some of this old punk gear is worth thousands.” A teen of the late 1970s, punk was Jordan’s escape from growing up on a drab Merseyside council estate through an economic recession. It was a wild time, Jordan, now 61, recalls, though nothing like the handed-down caricatures of punk anarchy today. “It wasn’t all sitting in doorways drinking lager with a dog on a string,” he explains. “Johnny Rotten said, ‘Get off your arse!’ – don’t sit on it. Punk was always more about outrageousness and embracing life.” , Outdoor pianos, celebrity names and free tuition videos combine to get Britons tickling the ivories once more For years, it seemed like the piano was disappearing from British public life. The bulky instruments were cast out of homes and schools and offered for free online. But now – despite all the digital entertainment alternatives and conductor Simon Rattle’s stark warning last week that UK classical music was fighting for its life amid funding cuts – the piano seems to be making a 21st-century comeback in homes, on streets and online. , Your husband is breaking promises and not listening to you. You’re hurt and frustrated, and desperate for things to change, but don’t act in haste or rageThe dilemma I am 47, have two primary-school children and a marriage that is in slow decline. From our initial pre-marriage ideals of a kind of Scandinavian shared approach to parenting and marriage it became apparent that, in fact, our underlying approach was that of his parents. The expectation is that I do everything. Nothing is done in an abusive way, but there is a passive detachment which I see in him that mirrors his dad. In his side of the family, the women run around doing everything while the men watch TV and discuss the news. I have brought this up numerous times, both in frustration and anger and in calmer, sadder moments. My husband will acknowledge this when I am calmer and will try to be more of an equal partner, but after a short time everything falls back to how it has been. I often think about being single. I am not interested in being with another man, but sometimes I find myself wondering if I would have a more equal relationship with a woman. I don’t want to break up because of our children. I have talked with him about splitting up, but he only laughs. Do I stay married? Or should I get out? ,  Nepo and Liren play four 25+10 games to decide champion Tweet Bryan at @BryanAGraham or email him Another flurry of moves: 7. Bg2 O-O 8. b4 Ng4 9. Bd4 Qc7 10. O-O e5 11. h3 exd4 12. hxg4 dxc3 13. Nxc4 Nxb4 14. a3 Bf6. Interestingly, it’s Nepomniachtchi who has fallen about five minutes behind on the clock early on after Ding has spent most of the past three weeks under time pressure. The Chinese challenger’s preparation for today’s first game has been spot-on. The first rapid game is under way and Ding goes with the trusty Queen’s Pawn opening (1. d4). They blitz out the opening moves from there (1. ... Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c3 c5 4. dxc5 e6 5. Be3 Be7 6. g3 Nc6). Nepomniachtchi with an early pawn sacrifice. ,  Brecel wins 11 straight frames in greatest Crucible fightback Allen wins five in row from 16-10 down before also losing 17-15 Luca Brecel produced the greatest ever Crucible comeback as he won 11 frames in a row against Si Jiahui while Mark Selby held off a Mark Allen fightback in a match that finished after midnight to set up a mouthwatering World Snooker Championship final. After the amazing comeback in the afternoon by Brecel, it looked as if there could be another as Allen, trailing 16-10, started pegging Selby back. The Northern Irishman won five frames in a row and his opponent, a four-time world champion, was looking jittery but managed to get over the line 17-15 at 12.45am. , British player’s astonishing US Open triumph seems all the more surprising given injury problems she has suffered since As the players settled in Madrid for the fourth ATP Masters 1000 event of the season, one competitor was extremely unsettled. In her pre-tournament press conference on Tuesday, Emma Raducanu entered the room determined to keep every response as short as possible. One-word answers were preferred. Her day’s work came in at 58 words. Eventually, the moderator recognised the futility of continuing and aborted her media briefing. The spectacle was concerning. The past 18 months have been difficult for various reasons and Britain’s young hope has become increasingly guarded, but the positive perspective she had tried to exude in public for much of this period was gone. , Ticket prices are proving an expense too far and some fans are ditching the Premier League for local community clubs As the season draws to a close, and the cost of living crisis continues to bite, football fans will be thinking about the expense of attending regular matches. In Germany, Fortuna Düsseldorf last week said they would offer free tickets to supporters, but how are English clubs responding to financial pressures on their fanbase? According to the Office for National Statistics, 38% of adults are spending more on everyday items. For match-goers, ticket prices are often proving an expense too far. , Sexual harassment is another workplace abuse that once seen as trivial, but not any more First, there were the CBI allegations. “Everyone should be bullied once in their lifetime,” an employee was allegedly told during a “campaign of verbal abuse” at the organisation. There was Dominic Raab’s indignant resignation – he had rashly promised in advance to accept the findings of a bullying inquiry against him, only to find that in the event he didn’t accept them at all. And now new bullying allegations are surfacing, this time around the health secretary, Steve Barclay. , The public interest requires an open and scrupulous process to find the person best suited to perform an important role in our national lifeThat’s a blow for the theory of nominative determinism. Richard Sharp was terribly dim when it came to realising that he could not possibly continue as chair of the BBC. A magician he may have been at making money at Goldman Sachs, and a wizard operator at forging political connections, and some at the broadcaster thought him a capable chair, but he was a fool to think that he could somehow ride out the storm. When he finally announced his resignation on Friday, departing with some chaff about not wanting to be a “distraction”, this was long after it was obvious that he was fatally compromised. “It was inevitable,” says a former Conservative cabinet minister. “Everyone could see how this was going to end,” comments a senior Labour frontbencher. Not just one, but two, damning investigations found against him. The first finding, produced some weeks ago by the Commons select committee which covers the media, concluded that he made “significant errors of judgment” when he failed to reveal that he had helped to facilitate a secret personal loan for Boris Johnson when he was still at Number 10. That made a mockery of the appointments process because it denied vital information to those scrutinising it. The second report, by Adam Heppinstall KC for the public appointments commissioner, was unequivocal that he unambiguously breached the governance code. , Its judgments are often inaccurate and outdated and they put undue stress on heads and teachers. We need a more intelligent approach to inspectionsChoosing your child’s school can feel like immensely high stakes. They will spend years living and breathing that choice, and it will almost inevitably be where their younger siblings go. So it was sighs of relief all round this month when my niece got into her first-choice primary, a lovely school where she attends nursery, and the only one that’s a walk away. How to pick a school isn’t always obvious. Distance is a factor; parents often visit to get a feel; and there is a range of public information, from Ofsted inspection reports to pupil attainment data. Is it better to go for a school rated “good” by Ofsted that you can walk to, or is an “outstanding” school worth the daily drive or bus? What happens if the head leaves an outstanding school a year or two in, given the difficulties in recruiting a new one because of the risk it might be downgraded next time? , Oliver Dowden’s appointment as deputy PM proves that the Conservatives’ shallow well of talent is as rancid as our waterways All across the land the emergency alarm went off. Oliver Dowden had been appointed deputy prime minister. The harsh metallic tone of the mobile phone sounded suspiciously like the rattle of a barrel being scraped bare. Metal on metal. There’s not an ounce of talent left in the Tory party. If it was a circus elephant you’d put a bullet in its head and have done with it. A kindness. Dominic Skeletor Raab is gone, currently preparing to spend more time with the sentient throbbing vein in his head that tells him who can live and who must die. The Conservative response to Raab’s transgressions is not to make sure ministers stop bullying civil service staff, but instead to recruit only party loyalists who will be grateful for the honour of being shouted at by a top Tory, rather than kicking up a fuss. Those wet wipes! Those silly bitches! , The home secretary is emboldening the far right by pointing the finger at ethnic groupsIn a recent Spectator column, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, claimed that by highlighting the Pakistani ethnicity of grooming gang members in a “string of cases”, she was merely pointing out “unfashionable facts”. Yet why zero in on a string of cases that received extensive media coverage, rather than acknowledging the full scale of the problem based on the data we have about all such cases? To learn that half a million British children are sexually abused each year should drive us to anger and action. We are right to want to know how to tackle a problem taking place on such a vast national scale. But we cannot tackle a problem if we fail to truly see what that problem is. And that means seeing it through the lens of fact. , There’s more to celebrate than coupling and procreating, a C of E report has admittedRejoice, ye singleton, for this week, thou art truly blessed. On Wednesday, the Church of England released the findings of its report on families and households and one of the key messages, endorsed by the archbishops of Canterbury and York, is that it’s about time we honoured the state of singleness. The commission, which has consulted over the past two years, “believes strongly that single people must be valued at the heart of our society” and wants the church to celebrate them. , Polling reveals most voters can now see through the referendum’s lies much more clearly than their leaders  ‘Half a league, half a league, / Half a league onward. / All in the valley of Death, / Rode the six hundred.” Why does Tennyson’s great poem come to mind as the local garage waits for a spare part to be delivered from Turin to fix a problem with my Fiat? In pre-Brexit days, thanks to Margaret Thatcher’s great achievement in integrating the British economy into the European single market, spare parts for cars, dishwashers – you name it – could be delivered almost overnight thanks to the sophistication of the EU supply chain. , One writer describes the shock of seeing the streets where she lives peppered with bullets That morning when the fighting started will remain with me for ever. It started normally enough: I planned to break the Ramadan fast with a group of journalists in downtown Khartoum, preparing myself to go out for an appointment with a musician in our home in Omdurman, the city on the other side of the Nile from Khartoum. Then, around 9am, I saw messages from colleagues about sounds of gunfire coming from south Khartoum, so I thought I would go and see what was going on. Soon I was hearing about fighting between the Rapid Support Forces and the army around the airport, the presidential palace, and the military headquarters. I know all of these locations very well, and most of them are very close to the neighbourhood where all the newspapers are based and where I often work. Now they were a war zone. , It’s time for baby boomers to share their spoils with the young, or else trouble lies aheadThe promise that living in an affluent society with a healthy economy holds out is that successive generations will enjoy ever-greater opportunities. But in the UK that intergenerational covenant is under threat, thanks to a housing market that means falling numbers of people will own their own home, and an ageing society in which today’s young people will shoulder the burden of higher taxes to meet the health and care costs of their parents’ generation. Sir Keir Starmer is right to focus on this as one of the most important issues a Labour government must address in his interview with the Observer today. So many factors are against today’s young people. First, there are the inherently difficult economics of an ageing society, the product of falling birthrates. Britain will need to spend a higher proportion of GDP on healthcare and pensions as our population of older people increases, with fewer working-age taxpayers to shoulder these costs. And people in their 20s and 30s will not have the same private pension provision as this generation of retired workers, many of whom have benefited from generous defined-benefit schemes long since closed to younger workers. , A public figure should know better than to deny the existence of anti-Jewish racismDiane Abbott denies that Travellers, Irish and Jewish people ever, at any point in their lives and at any point in history, experience racism (“Racism is black and white”, Letters). She justifies this by observing that “Jewish people… were not required to sit at the back of the bus”. Maybe not, but Jewish people were rounded up on to trains and transported to death camps – to say nothing of the pubs and hotels whose signs used to read: “No Jews, no Blacks, no Irish.” I would be delighted to invite Ms Abbott to my synagogue, where she can meet the security volunteers who keep us safe from antisemitic attacks, and watch us reading from a Torah scroll saved from destruction during the Holocaust. Perhaps, then, she will understand how inappropriate it is for a public figure to make extraordinary and inflammatory remarks such as denying the existence of anti-Jewish racism.Rabbi Gabriel Kanter-WebberBrighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue , A moment of weakness on TV has done nothing for the president’s strongman image in a country already tiring of authoritarian ruleTurkey’s strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is looking a little weaker this weekend after dramatically falling ill on live television during campaigning for 14 May presidential and parliamentary elections. Erdoğan, 69, has ruthlessly wielded power, as prime minister and president, for 20 years. His carefully cultivated image is of a tough, indestructible leader. Yet suddenly he appears frail. Ministers insist that his illness – he has previously had intestinal surgery – is nothing more serious than stomach flu. He rejoined the fray on Saturday. , Shadow secretary for culture calls for root and branch review of top appointments Ministers are facing fresh demands to bolster the independence of the process to find the next BBC chair after claims that “cronyism and sleaze” have damaged the role and the corporation’s reputation. The government has been pressed to depoliticise the appointment of the job after the resignation of Richard Sharp, a Tory donor. He quit after an independent investigation found he had failed to reveal critical information about his role in facilitating a loan for then prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job. , Government to extend powers to target fakes and fraudsters  Cold calls offering financial products will be banned as part of a government crackdown on fraud following evidence that millions of people are being targeted each week. Once the ban is in force, anyone being offered phoney cryptocurrency schemes or fraudulent insurance can assume they are a scam. , Musk calls the one-click move a win for both the public and media organisations Twitter CEO Elon Musk said on Saturday that the social media platform will allow media publishers to charge users on a per-article basis with one click, calling it a win for both the public and media organisations. The feature, to be rolled out in May, will enable users who do not “sign up for a monthly subscription to pay a higher per article price for when they want to read an occasional article”, billionaire owner Musk tweeted. , Brenton Craig Abbas Abdullah McArthur faces up to 14 months in prison if convicted  Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast An Australian man is facing more than a year in jail after allegedly spitting in the face of an imam at an Indonesian mosque.

In 2016 she was Bafta-nominated for The Diary of a Teenage Girl and shortlisted for a British independent film award for playing Princess Margaret in A Royal Night Out. Subsequent film roles include The King of Staten Island and Mary Shelley, where she met her fiance, actor Douglas Booth. On TV, she’s starred in The Morning Show and Dolly Alderton’s Everything I Know About Love. She now plays Hermine “Miep” Gies in miniseries A Small Light, based on the true story of the young woman who hid the Frank family during the second world war and preserved Anne’s diary. Were you familiar with Miep Gies’s story?I’d read Anne Frank’s diary as a kid, and I’m Jewish myself, so you grow up with this weight of history running through your family, but I knew nothing about Miep Gies. I was offered the role on Holocaust Memorial Day, which felt kind of special, but was genuinely like: Who is that? Nor did I know about the occupation of the Netherlands and the Dutch resistance. The first thing I did was get my butt over to Amsterdam. It’s a city that operates in a very specific way – everyone cycles everywhere, it’s built on waterways – so I immersed myself in how it feels to live there. I visited the Anne Frank museum, obviously, but also went to Miep’s old apartment and cycled the same routes as her. That was my springboard for working on this. , It’s late and over budget but the Museum of Natural History’s $465m gallery gives a stunning home to its insects Some museums have more personality than others and the American Museum of Natural History has never had trouble attracting attention. Packed with rare specimens, organic samples and glittering minerals, as well as some uncannily lifelike animal and human models, the New York institution has long featured in urban legend, as well as on the big screen. So this week – despite the fact that the Metropolitan Museum, its larger, arty sister directly across Central Park, is to hold its glitzy annual gala on Monday – the AMNH will still be competing for headlines. After nine years of planning, a pandemic and $465m (£370m) spent, the museum opens an audacious new building on Thursday – the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation. , Lisa Cortés’s richly enjoyable film examines the alter egos and queer theories surrounding a conflicted star who was way ahead of his time If Little Richard AKA Richard Wayne Penniman, was criminally underrated for much of his career, his legacy has burned bright since his death in May 2020. Last weekend, the BBC debuted James House’s Little Richard: King and Queen of Rock ’n’ Roll, a solid, feature-length UK/US co-production that’s now on iPlayer. Meanwhile, the Dee Rees exec-produced Little Richard: I Am Everything, which premiered at Sundance back in January, is in UK cinemas. Unsurprisingly, there’s significant crossover between the docs in terms of archive footage and interviewees (Nile Rogers tells pretty much the same story in both – about David Bowie wanting to sound the way Little Richard looked). But the films also have distinctly different approaches, with director Lisa Cortés leaning further into the queer-theory aspects of Penniman’s ever-changing alter egos. , As his second novel is published, the award-winning writer talks about being doubted as a teenager, the courage of his migrating ancestors, and how he uses his photography to spark stories Chaotic conditions in Peckham: brolly-ruining wind, sudden showers, one of those afternoons when the weather apps show every symbol from sunshine to lightning and leave you to figure it out. Caleb Azumah Nelson, the 29-year-old author and artist whose prose and photographs tend to document life in south London, was meant to be showing me around today. We might have swung by the Peckhamplex cinema, the public library off Rye Lane, maybe getting as far as Morley’s burger bar to the south or Bagel King further north – all of which places Nelson has written about in his beautiful second novel, Small Worlds, a follow-up to 2021’s Open Water, which won the Costa first novel award. Instead of roaming, as planned, we’re taking shelter from heavy rain under an awning outside Peckham Rye station. Nelson recently spent eight weeks on a writers’ retreat in north-east America. “There was a polar vortex or something,” he says. “It was minus 40. Balaclava weather. My eyelashes actually froze together.” Today’s grey city rain is no great hardship by comparison. We set out to find a cafe he likes on Rye Lane, fighting with our umbrellas all the way. , High-octane spy thriller Citadel knows how to have a good time; Malpractice plays as a medical Line of Duty; Big Mick and co return in comedy gold The Curse; and Arena tries to get behind the sunglasses of Karl Lagerfeld Citadel (Amazon Prime Video)Malpractice (ITVX) | itv.comThe Curse (Channel 4) | channel4.comThe Mysterious Mr Lagerfeld (BBC Two) | iPlayer A hurtling train. The black outline of a man falling through fiery, Lucozade-hued water. An elite collective (Manticore) vowing to bring down Citadel, a network of secret agents devoted to global “safety and security”. It must be a new spy thriller series. And going by the first two episodes of David Weil’s six-part Citadel on Amazon Prime Video, an old-school (red-blooded, sexy) one at that. , The great chronicler of Ukraine breaks new ground in his rigorous and elegant analysis of Europe’s biggest conflict since 1945 – and its impact on friends and family On 23 February 2022, Serhii Plokhy was in Vienna on sabbatical from his teaching job at Harvard. He went to bed hoping the disturbing news on CNN was somehow wrong. Like many others, including his country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian historian was reluctant to believe Russia was about to launch a full-scale assault on his homeland. The omens suggested otherwise. That autumn, Vladimir Putin had massed tanks and battalions close to Ukraine’s borders. And yet it was hard to believe this portended a brazen imperial expedition by one state against another, and the biggest war in Europe since 1945. “I believed the troop movement was part of Russian blackmail,” Plokhy writes. , The beauty industry’s most prestigious makeup artists are ready to give you a helping hand… here’s howApplying makeup professionally requires great products and also great skill, hence most of us simply do what we do and hope for the best.

In the nearly five years I’ve been writing this column, I’ve sometimes been accused of making up the more alarming things that have happened to me. This is not the case, as many of my more incident-free columns should sadly prove. ‘Please,’ I say to family and friends, damning myself with every word, ‘if I made stuff up, my column would be a lot more exciting.’ It’s just that when something unlikely or horrifying does happen to me, I jump at it with both hands. The sad, obvious truth about parenting is that much of it is very boring. The sad, obvious truth about writing about parenting is that ‘much of it is very boring’ will not suffice. Knowing this cannot remedy the fact that there are simply weeks in which nothing of any interest happens to me at all, and I’m forced to tackle things from whatever angle I can. This was a problem when I had one child, who often did very little or, worse, did nothing but the one thing I’d already written an article about some weeks previously. I’ve so far avoided writing a column entitled: ‘Yet more adventures in potty training’, but I could have done for most of 2022. And now I have a daughter, I find she alternates between doing very little and doing things that her brother has already done. All of which means, to paraphrase Vivian Mercier’s famous review of Waiting for Godot, ‘Not only does nothing happen, nothing happens twice.’ , There are no ‘nul points’ in this super selectionLike many people, I grew up watching Eurovision. So it was a real thrill to put together a mini Eurovision box, with five full-size bars, £34.95 (10% discount for readers with EUROAB10, valid until end of June) representing six nations (one bar represents two countries). The dual bar is Puchero’s Churros bar, a 38% milk with real churros crushed into it. It’s the sort of bar you’d eat at a midnight feast and not regret a bit of, and perfect for munching while watching Eurovision 2023. The bar is made in Spain, but one of the makers is Italian. It is addictive, so be careful. Table’s 61% Haitian milk is made in Liverpool, which is entirely fitting given it is the host city. It is so creamy it’ll remind you of childhood chocolate (which we know didn’t really taste like that but memories do become more golden with time). , Celebrate the Coronation and raise a glass with some premium home-grown bubblesChapel Down Sparkling Brut, England NV (£21.99, Waitrose) Amid all the pomp and circumstance of next weekend’s festivities, it’s easy to see why the English wine business spies a good opportunity. It’s all part of English wine’s remarkable progress over the past couple of decades, a period in which it has gone from a largely amateurish pursuit to become, to use the UK government’s ludicrously boosterish parlance honestly for once, a ‘world-beating’ industry. Certainly, the Coronation, like last year’s Platinum Jubilee, will have its share of commemorative bottlings by English sparkling producers and it seems likely that many punters will, as they did last June, take the patriotic option as their sparkling choice at parties and gatherings. Among the producers making a special cuvée for King Charles is one of the biggest, Chapel Down, which has released a 2,000-bottle run of Coronation Edition from the 2016 vintage at £65 a pop. I’ve not tried it, but the company’s regular, widely available Brut NV is among the most consistently enjoyable English sparkling wines around. Leckford Sparkling Brut, England NV (£24.99, Waitrose) One measure of English fizz’s progress is the confidence its leading producers now have in selling at prices akin to top champagne. Chapel Down’s Kit’s Coty Coeur de Cuvée 2016 goes for £120 a bottle, while Gusbourne’s 51° North 2014 costs £195. English sparkling wine has been adopted by the supermarkets, all of which now have an own-label or two of the style on their shelves. Waitrose has taken the idea even further, having planted a small vineyard at the company’s farm, Leckford Estate, in Hampshire, in 2009. The sparkling brut, which is made from Leckford’s pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay grapes by the well-established Ridgeview Estate in East Sussex, is very good indeed, with a mix of typically nervy English Cox’s apple acidity and buttered toasty notes. , The garden beds and house are filled with yellows and blues, the first of spring’s many flowers Spring at the summerhouse. The meadow is alive with primroses. Runs of soft-coloured flowers, nestling in corners, carpeted under trees. Many more than ever before. Sharp celandines, too, a brighter, braver yellow. Scattered through the banks, dotted through the grass. Nodding violets in white, and deep purple, shelter in the hedges, spray out under low-hanging branches. A perfect perfume. , The country has recorded its hottest, driest April yet. For people working outdoors, it’s no joke There are many better places to be in Spain than Madrid when recordbreaking temperatures bring summer’s ruthless heat in spring, prompting government health warnings, action plans from regional authorities and the familiar agonising wait for outdoor public pools to open. There are also many better places to be in Madrid when the mercury nudges 30C (86F) than under a woolly hat inside a furry Sonic the Hedgehog costume in the elegant, shadeless air fryer that is the Spanish capital’s Plaza Mayor. , As 2024 election season gets under way the network must figure out how to keep its audience – and its advertisers – happy In less than a week, Fox News has agreed to pay out $787.5m in a huge legal settlement and fired its most popular host, in an unprecedented crisis for America’s most-watched cable news channel just as a critical presidential election cycle begins. With the 2024 election essentially already under way, rightwing Fox News must now wrestle – quickly – with how to hold on to the audience that Tucker Carlson, the incendiary rightwing extremist who was fired on Monday, captured and cultivated during his murky seven-year tenure as a primetime host. , Democrats center abortion rights in early stages of presidential campaign while Republicans waver over unpopular position Hours after Joe Biden announced his re-election campaign on Tuesday, his vice-president and 2024 running mate, Kamala Harris, delivered a fiery call to action for voters alarmed by the loss of constitutional protections for abortion. “This is a moment for us to stand and fight,” she said to a packed auditorium at Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington and her alma mater. To the “extremist so-called leaders” rolling back access to reproductive rights, Harris warned: “Don’t get in our way because if you do, we’re going to stand up, we’re going to organize and we’re going to speak up.” , Permissive self-defense and gun laws spotlighted by recent shootings in which victims approached gunmen by mistake Waldes Thomas and Diamond Darville were driving for the grocery delivery service Instacart near Miami in mid-April when they drove the order up to the wrong address. Thomas, 19, and Darville, 18, reportedly told authorities they were backing away from the home when the owner emerged with his son, grabbed on to the driver’s window and fired a gun three times at their car. Antonio Caccavale, who didn’t hit anyone, later reportedly claimed to police who investigated the encounter that he shot because he feared for his and his son’s lives as Thomas and Darville’s car ran over his foot and struck a boulder. , In a time before luxury flats and Google offices, the docklands of the Liffey were ruled by tykes on bikes In 1985, Syd Shelton recalls, children on bikes still ruled the streets; there weren’t so many cars, and kids didn’t have phones to stare at. He took this picture in Dublin, near the docks. He was in the city preparing a photographic project called Ireland: A Week in the Life of a Nation. Fifty photographers, some famous, such as William Klein, were due to arrive to capture the country in pictures. In the meantime, Shelton had some time to wander. He thinks of this picture as a street portrait rather than something entirely spontaneous: “I was using flash and a tripod and the image was very much a conversation between me and the kids.” The street with the gasometers was in Ringsend, on the south bank of the Liffey. At the time it was entirely a residential area – some of the houses were built by William Beckett, Samuel’s grandfather, in the 1880s. Many of them have now been demolished. Ringsend is the home of Google’s European HQ, and the gasometer has been redeveloped as luxury apartments. Shelton has another photograph from that afternoon in 1985. “I got the kids on bikes to gather their mates,” he says, “and I took a picture of 40 of them, with the gasometer behind.” Seen Not Heard is at Atlas Gallery, London W1, 19 May-24 June , Om Dhungel escaped ethnic persecution in Bhutan to make a new life in Australia. The strength and potential of refugees like him, he says, is vastly underestimated  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email In his first weeks in Australia on a student visa, Om Dhungel wanted to get a job to send money to his family in Nepal, all refugees driven out of Bhutan. But people here struggled to understand his accent. Sometimes, they would mistakenly call him Tom. Soon after arriving in Sydney, he spotted a vacancy sign on the street, and excitedly pulled his borrowed car in to apply for a position – but it was a motel sign, not a workplace. “I laugh at it now, but I actually cried after that,” chuckles the slim, moustachioed and bespectacled 61-year-old, almost 25 years later. ]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Ukraine forms eight new storm brigades; Black Sea grain meeting to be held on Wednesday Ukraine has formed eight new “storm” brigades to take part in a future counteroffensive amid growing speculation about its timing and whether it can inflict serious defeats on Russia. The Ukrainian interior ministry said it had “fully formed” initial brigades comprising up to 40,000 troops, but they would need further training before being ready to fight. An explosion derailed a freight train for the second day in a row in a Russian region bordering Ukraine on Tuesday, sending both the locomotive and some cars off the tracks, authorities said. It occurred in the western Bryansk region, which borders both Ukraine and Belarus. Russian officials say pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups have made multiple attacks there since 2022. The US plans to announce as soon as Wednesday a new $300m military aid package for Ukraine that will for the first time include a short-range air-launched rocket, two US officials have said. The rockets could help Ukraine weaken Russian ground positions and provide advancing Ukrainian ground forces with air support for a spring offensive. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said his country was inflicting heavy blows to Ukraine across the entire frontline but the supply of weapons was crucial to success. In a meeting with Moscow’s top military officials, Shoigu said Russian combat operations were engaged “along the entire line of contact”, fighting Ukraine and its “unprecedented military assistance from the west”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said German-supplied weapons were already being used in the Donbas region, which Russia has illegally annexed. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Monday that Germany had insisted, like other Nato member countries, that the weapons it was supplying to Ukraine must not be used against Russian territory. The Donbas is not Russian territory. Ukraine’s military vowed on Tuesday not to give up the eastern city of Bakhmut as it prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russian forces. General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, underlined the importance Kyiv attaches to holding Bakhmut as preparations continue for a counterattack that it hopes will change the dynamic of the war. Russia’s military has sustained 100,000 deaths and injuries in the past five months in fighting against Ukraine, mostly in the Bakhmut region, the White House has estimated. The national security spokesperson John Kirby said the figure, based on US intelligence estimates, included more than 20,000 dead. The Kremlin rejected the US assessment of Russian military casualties in Ukraine as having been “plucked from thin air” and said Washington had no way of obtaining the correct data. Turkey’s trade data has started to reflect that Ankara has stopped allowing the re-exportation of sanctioned western goods to Russia after repeated warnings from Washington, a senior US treasury official has told reporters. All parties in the Black Sea grain initiative will meet for talks on Wednesday, according to a senior Ukrainian source. Additionally, the senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan is expected to travel to Moscow this week. At least six Russian regions have scrapped 9 May Victory Day parades to mark the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany amid fear of Ukrainian attacks. The governor of Saratov, 400 miles from the border, announced that its parade was off because of “safety concerns”. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that three apartment buildings and a school were damaged in Kramatorsk in a strike by Russian S-300 missiles that caused one injury. , British Museum, LondonCenturies of conflict between the civilisations of Persia and Greece are chiefly captured through elaborate drinking vessels in this lively – and occasionally puzzling – show A pair of sculpted heads stare at each other at the start of this exhibition: an ancient Persian with a square beard and tight ringlets facing up to the Greek god Apollo. Here is a polarity that has defined global history. The struggle between the Greek city states and the Achaemenid empire was believed by the Greeks to be a fight to establish who they were: western, not eastern, self-governing, and democratic in the case of Athens, as opposed to the playthings of Persian tyrants. But guess what – the reality was more complicated. The Persian portrait and the Chatsworth Apollo, as it’s known, are not so different. Both come from 5th century BC Cyprus, and are associated with sanctuaries where Apollo and the Persian god Reshef were jointly worshipped. , Lampard has lost six in a row but this team is the result of a bad plan, enacted badly, by people who are bad at enacting plans It lives. It breathes. Those drooping limbs have bloomed with new life. There will be time, also, for the most startling aspect of this late season knockabout at the Emirates, the strange, zombified spectacle currently operating as Chelsea Football Club. Before that the headlines will rightly be about Arsenal, on a night when their own apparently doomed title push thrust a fist up through the turf and dragged itself back up on to its it feet. A 3-1 win means that Arsenal are now two points clear at the top of the league, albeit having played two matches more than a Manchester City team that seems to win games these days simply by turning up and pointing itself vaguely in the right direction. Arsenal were peppy and busy and full of clever angles for as long as it was necessary to be any of those things, which wasn’t very long at all. , Investments in Bristol and Santo Tomas in the Philippines will be worth £100m and £166m respectively Dyson has revealed plans to build a new battery factory in Singapore, alongside investments by the maker of vacuum cleaners and dryers in technology centres in the UK and the Philippines. The company, run by the billionaire Sir James Dyson, said the investments in Bristol in the UK and Santo Tomas in the Philippines would be worth £100m and £166m respectively. The Singapore investment will be significantly larger. , Perinatal mental health services do not meet national quality standards, report finds Women’s lives are being put at risk by substandard mental health care during their pregnancy and in the first year after childbirth in most parts of the UK, a report has found. About one in every five women develops a mental illness at some point during the perinatal period, the stage from pregnancy up to a year after giving birth. However, none of the health and social care boards in Northern Ireland or Wales met the national quality standards created by the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Perinatal Quality Network (PQN). , Nuria Piera, known for her investigations into corruption, was targeted three times, Amnesty International says One of the Dominican Republic’s most prominent investigative journalists was targeted using spyware made by NSO Group, according to a new report released by Amnesty International. Nuria Piera, who is well known for her investigations into corruption, was hacked three times between 2020 and 2021, according to Amnesty’s forensic analysis of her mobile phone. The revelation marks the first confirmation that NSO’s military-grade spyware, Pegasus, has been used to target journalists in the Dominican Republic, making it the third Latin American country – after Mexico and El Salvador – where such abuse has been discovered. ,  Jordi Alba scores winner against Osasuna in 85th minute Real Madrid lose; RB Leipzig hammer Freiburg 5-1 in Cup Barcelona are just one win away from winning La Liga after their 1-0 victory over Osasuna was followed by Real Madrid losing 2-0 away to Real Socieded.

Democrats had convened a hearing of the Senate judiciary committee after a series of media reports on entanglements between two of the court’s conservative justices and parties with interests in its cases. These includes Clarence Thomas’s acceptance of luxury travel and a real estate deal from Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow, and Neil Gorsuch’s sale of a property to a law firm executive with business before the court. Both were interactions the two justices did not fully disclose. , Seven others taken to hospital with stab wounds after serious altercation in the early hours of Sunday morning A man has been charged with the murder of a 32-year-old man in an incident near a nightclub in Cornwall where several people sustained stab injuries, police said.

Lisa Birnbach testified at Carroll’s civil action against the former president on Tuesday that she was feeding her children at home when Carroll called “breathless, hyperventilating, emotional” in spring 1996.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday night said it plans to abolish the stricter “premium” class of London stock market listing, and make it easier for company founders to keep control of businesses using US-style “golden shares”, among a series of big changes to City regulations. , New fraud strategy responding to web- and phone-based scams will result in recruitment of 400 new ‘specialist investigators’ Ministers have announced a clampdown on the use of cold calls to sell financial products and on technology which allows mass texting of numerous phones as part of a strategy to combat fraud, now the UK’s most common crime. The new fraud strategy, a response to the massive growth of web- and phone-based scams, will alsoresult in what was billed as 400 new specialist investigators across police and the National Crime Agency recruited as part of a revamp for how the the crime is investigated. , Number of companies listed on main market in London has fallen by 40% since 2008 Does the UK stock market need the biggest shake-up since the 1980s of the rules that apply to listed companies? Well, it’s hard to deny that something has gone wrong – and was going wrong before the Japanese owner of Arm Holdings delivered the latest snub by opting to list the Cambridge-based chip-maker, the UK’s tech champion, in New York. The number of companies with a listing on the main market in London has fallen by 40% since 2008. Meanwhile, UK pension funds and insurance companies have scarpered to the perceived safety of bonds. They owned 52% of the market in 1990; now just 4%. The buzz ain’t what it used to be. And, since a dynamic stock market tends to go hand in hand with wider economic health, decline matters. , “It’s not over,” Mikel Arteta had said on Monday. It feels as if it is, Manchester City just too powerful, as evidenced by their 4-1 dismissal of Arsenal last Wednesday. But Arsenal cannot allow their Premier League title push to fizzle out. They owe it to themselves after the excellent season they have produced. Arteta’s men kept up their side of the bargain, moving back to the top of the table, two points clear of City, having played two matches more, although to have failed to beat this Chelsea team would have been an abdication. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts 3 min: Saka and White combine briskly down the right, the latter crossing deep.

Leto’s look comfortably overshadowed acres of pearl-encrusted gowns at the Met’s annual fundraiser. The theme was late designer Karl Lagerfeld; Leto came as Choupette, the pet he reportedly left £1.3m ($1.6m) in his will and scored a major publicity land grab. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts The teams are out! Arsenal in their famous red with white sleeves, Chelsea their equally storied blue. (Of course, it could be Chelsea sporting white sleeves, as the novel idea was first proposed to their manager David Calderhead by Daily Mail cartoonist Tom Webster in the 1930s. But the conservative-with-small-c Calderhead didn’t fancy making the change, and it was Arsenal’s Herbert Chapman who ran with it instead.) Anyway, there’s a rare old derby noise at the Emirates, and we’ll be off in a couple of shakes. The pre-match predictions are in, and as Tarby would say on Winner Takes All, we have a difference of opinion. “Predicting that Chelsea come out and play a blinder: why do so many teams appear to be ‘up for it’ against the Arsenal?” – Bill Hargreaves , The civil service is ‘a team without a captain’, argues Anthony Seldon. But can Sunak stomach ousting Case before the election? Senior civil servants have been asking whether Simon Case can survive at the top of Whitehall for almost as long as he has been in post. From his oversight of No 10 during the Partygate scandal to his role in the Richard Sharp affair, Case’s name has cropped up in almost every controversy to dog Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak over the last two years. When a top official repeatedly becomes the story, more often than not that means their days in the job are numbered. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts Frank Lampard talks to Sky. “We’re coming to a really good team … it’s going to be tough for us … the challenge might not be a bad thing for us, because the players have to react … we have to show what we can do … individually we know there is a lot of talent in the squad but the nature of being a team against what has become a team with a real identity here is a challenge for us … [Aubameyang] has a history of scoring goals and maybe a motivation to play here … Noni has trained really well, and when you come in with a big squad you need players who show something in training and he’s shown that … it’s a big job, it’s a challenge, as a club we’ve been really successful for a long time and this is a year of transition on many levels … that can bring obvious difficulties but also excuses and we have to put those to bed … you don’t succeed unless you have togetherness, standards, spirit, and maybe that’s been affected this year … so it’s difficult to put a time frame on it … it may take time … it has to be a collective … Arsenal are a good reference point … we’ve got a hard run-in but the players have a lot to play for … I see a team low on confidence … but the natural talent is there … this league is unforgiving … I’m very positive about the squad but the players need to work and work hard.” Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports, considers the six-day break Arsenal have enjoyed since the City defeat. “It was necessary to reset, recharge the batteries and bring some clarity again, and focus on the big game tonight … we conceded too many goals, we had to shake it up, to give people opportunities they deserve … there are players who deserve to play minutes … they have a lot of players who are great on the break and we need some control of the game … City were exceptional on the day and reached a level we could not reach, I cannot fault the players … we didn’t win enough duels the other day … there are a lot of things we have to do much better today … we must play really well tonight, be us … and if we win this game we are top of the league again with four games to go.” , Home Office claims timing of new powers, taking effect days before king’s coronation, is coincidental Official warning letters have been sent to anti-monarchists planning peaceful protests at King Charles III’s coronation saying that new criminal offences to prevent disruption have been rushed into law. Using tactics described by lawyers as “intimidatory”, the Home Office’s Police Powers Unit wrote to the campaign group Republic saying new powers had been brought forward to prevent “disruption at major sporting and cultural events”. Protesters who block roads, airports and railways could face 12 months behind bars. Anyone locking on to others, objects or buildings could go to prison for six months and face an unlimited fine. Police will be able to head off disruption by stopping and searching protesters if they suspect they are setting out to cause chaos. , Cabinet Office says investigation paused until after watchdog decides whether to delay start of job with Keir Starmer • UK politics live –latest news updates The government has paused an internal inquiry into Sue Gray’s departure from Whitehall which was widely expected to have concluded that she had broken the civil service code. In a written statement, the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said the former senior official had not engaged with the investigation into her departure so it would be suspended while the government considered “next steps”. , Woman accused of murdering seven babies cries as she tells court she never harmed a child in her care Lucy Letby wept as she told a court her “whole world was stopped” when she was accused of the “sickening” murders of multiple babies in a hospital neo-natal unit.

Alfie Steele had 50 injuries on his body when he was found lifeless in a bath at home in Droitwich on 18 February 2021, and was later pronounced dead at Worcester Royal hospital. , Naturalist is suing three men over claims he fraudulently solicited donations for tiger charity Claims that Chris Packham fraudulently solicited donations for a charity that rescued tigers are among an “enormous amount of puerile, offensive and damaging material” published about him, the high court has heard. The prominent naturalist has alleged that Dominic Wightman, the editor of the online site Country Squire Magazine, as well as the writer Nigel Bean and a third man, Paul Read, libelled him in nine articles that referred to his involvement with the Wildheart Trust, which runs a wildlife sanctuary on the Isle of Wight. , Lisa Birnbach testifies that Carroll called her and described the incident in 1996, and that she told her friend ‘E Jean, he raped you’ A close friend of E Jean Carroll has told a New York jury that she received a distressed call from the advice columnist within minutes of Donald Trump allegedly raping her.

The websites churn out content relating to politics, health, environment, finance and technology at a “high volume”, the researchers found, to provide rapid turnover of material to saturate with adverts for profit. , Move to recruit up to 40,000 troops aimed at inflicting heavy losses on Russia in Bakhmut area  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates Eight new Ukrainian brigades of soldiers have been formed to take part in a future counteroffensive amid growing speculation about its timing and whether it can succeed in inflicting a serious defeat on the Russian invaders. The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Tuesday it had “fully formed” the initial “storm” brigades, comprising up to 40,000 troops, but added they would need further training before being ready to take part in fighting. , Governor of region 400 miles from border latest to cancel over ‘safety concerns’ in glaring admission of vulnerability At least six Russian regions have scrapped 9 May Victory Day parades that mark the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany amid fears over Ukrainian strikes, with a region 400 miles from the border being the latest to cancel. The governor of Saratov announced the parade there would not go ahead because of “safety concerns”, adding to a string of cancellations that are a glaring admission of the country’s military vulnerability more than 14 months into the war. , US estimates 20,000 Russian soldiers have died in five months; Black Sea grain initiative talks scheduled for Wednesday , Taken from a new book about the women of the Factory Records label, the New Order keyboardist remembers her daunting start with the band – and their nights out to fetish clubs Gillian Gilbert’s story as a musician – along with the numerous unseen women who worked for Factory Records – started well before the label became a sensation in 1983 with New Order’s Blue Monday. Gillian learned guitar and keys, occasionally played on stage with Joy Division, and later became a member of New Order – joining Stephen Morris, Bernard Sumner, and Peter Hook – following the tragic death of Ian Curtis in 1980. I got to know everybody [in New Order] and the manager, Rob [Gretton]. It was the manager who suggested, when Ian died, to bring another singer in, which they didn’t want to do. Eventually he said: “Why don’t you just bring somebody in that nobody thought would be brought in?” , Labour leader says they will be both going and staying – and he can’t say fairer or unfairer than that When you’re 15 points ahead in the polls with the local elections just two days away, some might argue that it is best to keep quiet. Especially if you haven’t really got much new to say. Why rock the boat when you’ve got a comfortable lead? No need to go for another goal when you’re five-nil up with only added time to play. Just keep it safe, bank the win and save your resources for more important games to come. Don’t give the Tory party chair, Greg Hands, an excuse to fire off another desperate tweet about Labour having spent all the money. Keir Starmer saw it rather differently. He had chosen to do a morning tour of the BBC studios. A last-chance power drive to remind everyone of what was at stake this week. Only he didn’t really appear to have given it much thought, as his only consistent message was that everyone was more broke than they had ever been. Almost as though he had imagined that just saying the same thing over and over again would get him through any 15-minute interview. , When Charles was crowned Prince of Wales, he didn’t know he was wearing a table tennis ball on his head. What can the world expect on Saturday? We examine the strange and often blood-drenched world of crown design When King Charles was invested as the Prince of Wales in 1969, the young royal went through all the pomp and ceremony unaware that the jazzy modern crown he wore on his head was topped with a ping-pong ball. The plastic sphere was, of course, well disguised: not only coated with gold filigree but also surrounded by a floating constellation of diamonds arranged in the shape of Charles’s star sign, Scorpio. It was pagan astrology meets high church meets high camp, a fittingly fruity headpiece for the eccentric prince. The crown was designed by Louis Osman, an architect and goldsmith described by one of his friends as “the original hippie” – and it marked a radical departure from the usual staid royal headwear. This was a futuristic vision featuring swooping golden arches surrounded by abstract fleurs-de-lis and needle-thin crosses that jutted out like splintering lightning bolts. The gold, symbolically, came from a Welsh nugget, but rather than being traditionally hammered it was – in a showcase of modern methods – electroplated on to an epoxy resin cast. An internal purple velvet cap banded with ermine completed the look, fulfilling Charles’s wish for a crown that could be worn by a “modern prince” with a regular haircut, not someone with a wig, and “ears that show”. , Amid cost of living crisis and reneged promises, Thursday’s outcome could swing on more local concerns On a typically grey day in Greater Manchester, the diggers are rumbling along the roads outside Bolton market. Half a decade since the last departure from the old Moor Road bus station, the council’s “masterplan” for redevelopment is still a work in progress. “It’s a big disappointment,” says Phyllis Waits, stopping with her husband, John, to buy fish in the market. “Bolton used to be thriving. It’s a Friday morning – it should be absolutely buzzing, but there are only a handful of shops left. Everywhere has closed.” , Annie O’Neill, who visits 33 schools a term, has noticed a huge rise in problems such as eating disorders  Calls for 11,000 more school nurses in UK Annie O’Neill has just finished delivering a session in which she has taught year 13 students to manage their anxious “glitter mind” with breathing exercises, CBT techniques and mindfulness. When the school nurse finishes, one of the students shyly shuffles up. After a long pause, she says: “I have a lot of pressure on me. All the time I have a voice in my head saying I’m not good enough.” The student is a high achiever with an offer at a top university and a supportive family, yet she cannot shake the feeling that although she spends so much time revising, nothing is going in. She has not spoken to anyone else about how overwhelmed she is feeling. , Armed robberies rise across Sudan capital as fighting causes breakdown in law and order Wearing loose clothes with guns in their pockets, a group of seven young men gather every night with a tray of tea on the terrace of one of their houses to guard their east Khartoum neighbourhood. A breakdown in law and order in the capital amid fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and an availability of guns in part driven by those that can be taken from the bodies of dead soldiers, has led to an increase in armed robberies. All prisoners in the capital – including convicted murderers – have been released or escaped from prisons and, in the absence of police, groups of civilians banding together to protect themselves. , There’s a little bit of popstar aiming for No 1 – and fans will enjoy lots of behind-the-scenes footage – but Sheeran appears as a homely, nice man struggling with difficult circumstances Cheekier viewers than me might wonder how this Disney+ documentary is going to manage to fill out an entire four-part series about the singer. Sheeran is massive, the biggest male pop star in the world, capable of selling out – as he does here – Wembley Stadium for the 12th time. Each of his albums goes to No 1; he’s played at practically every massive arena in the world. He sings with Eminem on stage; Beyoncé will perform with him. But if you only know about his life from the tabloids, or by gossip osmosis, you might know he has a pub, that he married a school friend, that he still lives in Suffolk, and has a pond that was briefly controversial. As a star, he is not so much champagne as he is pale ale. He has a homely quality to him. This homeliness belies a certain unknown aspect, though. Not unknown in the Beyoncé way, with that distant remove of a glossy machine, but unknown in the sense that his normal-guy shtick might be the extent of it. We see him as a hard worker done good. He appears to be a very nice man. The documentary – which, again, cheekier viewers might note, coincides with a high-profile court case against him, and does much to make him seem even more human and likable – foregrounds the unknown man, via the people who do know and love him, including his wife, Cherry, and his parents, John and Imogen. Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All is on Disney+ from 3 May. , How did the highly punchable Swede do? What about Ger-bear? Or Tom the corporate kiss-ass?

You didn’t quite make the cut. Hey, that’s business. Now let’s go full fucking boar and commence the countdown … , With its voter ID ruse and a bid to capture the civil service, the government is emulating US Republicans’ winner-takes-all populism Any competition with a prize worth having attracts cheats. That is as true of politics as it is of sport. Whether cheats prosper depends on a combination of regulation and culture. There must be rules, enforced by independent institutions, but also an ethos of honouring the rules, policed by conscience. The introduction of mandatory voter ID for local elections in England this week is doubly insidious because it smuggles dishonourable intent in a measure purporting to strengthen the rules. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist Rafael Behr will discuss his new book, Politics: A Survivor’s Guide, at a Guardian Live event on Monday 12 June. The event will be live in London and livestreamed. Book tickets here , Both parties emphasise ‘getting on the ladder’ to win middle-class votes, ignoring the vast majority of people affected by this emergency Britain is obsessed with home ownership. This might date back to our history of land ownership, class and colonial exploit but the fixation lives on, thanks in no small part to Thatcher’s introduction of the right to buy in 1980. This weekend, both parties made their bids to reckon with the housing crisis, and both leaders, predictably, zeroed in on ownership. The Tories have for years declared they would transform “generation rent” into “generation buy” and Rishi Sunak is now considering bringing back help to buy – a 2013 Tory policy that ended last year – to win votes at the next election. He also recently announced he would scrap the house-building target of 300,000 every year in England, displaying a wilful ignorance of what is actually needed to plug the housing deficit. House-building alone won’t solve the crisis, but it will hugely contribute to some of the most urgent needs in this country – namely the 1.3 million people on English council house waiting lists in need of social rented homes, many of whom are privately renting and sliding into poverty. (Meanwhile, the homes available to rent in the UK fell by a third over the past 18 months.) Kieran Yates is the author of All the Houses I’ve Ever Lived In , The list of things he derided included #MeToo, fat women, gay marriage and immigrants The theme for this year’s Met Gala wasn’t a concept; it was a person. But the organizers’ departure from their usual theming convention wasn’t the most controversial thing about the night. The real issue is that Karl Lagerfeld, the man they’ve chosen to honor, was also notoriously fatphobic, anti-immigrant, possibly homophobic and, many would say – despite his slew of famous muses – low-key misogynistic. , A contested settlement will do little to alleviate a chronic crisis which goes beyond issues of remuneration The ongoing wave of public sector strikes, some of which could continue into the autumn, has been motivated by two main factors. One – the most immediate – is the spike in inflation and the cost of living crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine. For workforces which had already endured a steady erosion of pay and living standards for over a decade, this amounted to a blow upon the bruise inflicted by austerity. The longer-term grievance relates to the more general underfunding and implicit undervaluing of public services, which successive Conservative governments have starved of necessary resources. For NHS employees especially, this has too often turned what should be the pursuit of a vocation into a quotidian exercise in putting out fires. The chronic recruitment and retention crises in our hospitals are the consequence of this dire combination of declining pay and increasingly beleaguered, morale-sapping working conditions. , Millions of children have missed routine immunisations due to the pandemic. But saving lives is about more than logistics The horror of the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it one small cause for optimism: the crisis accelerated the development of new vaccine technologies, with the potential to protect against other diseases. Yet this leap forward was accompanied by a dramatic backsliding in the delivery of existing vaccines, with 23 million children missing out on routine immunisations in 2020 and 25 million in 2021 – the largest sustained decline in three decades. The World Health Organization reports that more prevalent and severe outbreaks of preventable diseases, including diphtheria and polio, are already occurring. While three-quarters of the children who missed out lived in just 20 countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, there were declines in richer nations too. The UK Health Security Agency has warned that uptake of the meningococcal vaccine, and the last routine dose of the combined polio, diphtheria and tetanus vaccine, fell significantly last year among adolescents. Covid-19 overwhelmed healthcare systems and personnel, while lockdowns kept people away from facilities used to deliver shots. Supply chain disruption affected the availability of doses and syringes.

What would it take for us to confront greedflation today?, 28 April). Instead, I fear that Aldous Huxley was spot-on in his vision of a brave new world in which the masses are kept passive and constantly distracted by cheap thrills, soft drugs and an endless diet of trivia. More recently, Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death highlighted how the mass media has been used to provide constant puerile entertainment that distracts most of the population from serious matters of economics and politics. Most of the British public is now kept in a political stupor by endless stories about celebrities, soaps, reality TV, the manufactured melodrama surrounding the royals and the blaming of “the other” for our myriad economic and social problems – whether that “other” be refugees and migrants, supposedly idle workers, single parents, “greedy” unions, welfare claimants or the so-called liberal elite. , Tim Allen on guarding the guardians of democracy, and David Chan on the need to diversify those who work in the media The press is essential to a healthy democracy (Trust, diversity and independence: three key elements for a thriving press, 1 May). The conventional wisdom is that a “free” press is the guardian of democracy, but I would argue that it is, in fact, an unbiased press that serves that purpose. Should newspapers operate on the basis of neutrality? Perhaps they should be considered a public service. Responsible journalism should present the facts in a coherent way, with spin deciphered, and only then draw an editorial conclusion, if it is appropriate. But this cannot be the case when each publication panders to its ideological base or, more worryingly, to the interests of its owner. Then, the “free” press is a mere propaganda tool. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts Frank Lampard talks to Sky. “We’re coming to a really good team … it’s going to be tough for us … the challenge might not be a bad thing for us, because the players have to react … we have to show what we can do … individually we know there is a lot of talent in the squad but the nature of being a team against what has become a team with a real identity here is a challenge for us … [Aubameyang] has a history of scoring goals and maybe a motivation to play here … Noni has trained really well, and when you come in with a big squad you need players who show something in training and he’s shown that … it’s a big job, it’s a challenge, as a club we’ve been really successful for a long time and this is a year of transition on many levels … that can bring obvious difficulties but also excuses and we have to put those to bed … you don’t succeed unless you have togetherness, standards, spirit, and maybe that’s been affected this year … so it’s difficult to put a time frame on it … it may take time … it has to be a collective … Arsenal are a good reference point … we’ve got a hard run-in but the players have a lot to play for … I see a team low on confidence … but the natural talent is there … this league is unforgiving … I’m very positive about the squad but the players need to work and work hard.” Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports, considers the six-day break Arsenal have enjoyed since the City defeat. “It was necessary to reset, recharge the batteries and bring some clarity again, and focus on the big game tonight … we conceded too many goals, we had to shake it up, to give people opportunities they deserve … there are players who deserve to play minutes … they have a lot of players who are great on the break and we need some control of the game … City were exceptional on the day and reached a level we could not reach, I cannot fault the players … we didn’t win enough duels the other day … there are a lot of things we have to do much better today … we must play really well tonight, be us … and if we win this game we are top of the league again with four games to go.” , Gianni Infantino threatens a World Cup blackout yet Fifa is the architect of the chronic underfunding in the women’s game Prepare the spandex: women’s football superman Gianni “I have four daughters” Infantino is here to save the day. The president of Fifa has threatened a broadcasting blackout of the Women’s World Cup in the “big five” European countries of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France, blaming bids for the broadcast rights for the tournament that he said were a “slap in the face” to the players and “all women worldwide”. ,  Chelsea forward out for ‘a significant period’ with knee injury Leah Williamson out and Beth Mead poised to miss tournament Fran Kirby is the latest England player to be ruled out of the Women’s World Cup, with Chelsea saying the forward will be absent “for a significant period”. Kirby will undergo knee surgery after an injury sustained in Chelsea’s Continental Cup semi-final against West Ham in February. England’s captain Leah Williamson is out with an ACL injury, Sarina Wiegman has said Beth Mead needs a miracle to be fit and Kirby – another important member of the team that won Euro 2022 – will not be able to travel to Australia for the tournament in July. ,  FA charge Liverpool manager with improper conduct Klopp says he regrets that his words ‘opened the box’ Jürgen Klopp has admitted the referee Paul Tierney does not have an agenda against Liverpool and that he regrets detracting from the thrilling win against Tottenham on Sunday with his touchline conduct. The Football Association has charged the Liverpool manager with improper conduct for questioning Tierney’s integrity following the 4-3 victory at Anfield. Klopp also alleged the referee had spoken in an inappropriate manner when showing him a yellow card for confronting the fourth official, John Brooks. ,  Australian set for stint in County Championship ‘It’s something I’ve never done and always wanted to do’ Steve Smith has sought to douse the gently smouldering embers of controversy surrounding his use of the County Championship to prepare himself for facing England in this summer’s Ashes, insisting that his next few weeks at Sussex will make no difference whatsoever to his chances of success once the series gets under way in June. “I don’t think that’s the case at all,” he said of the possibility England would come to regret letting him into their domestic game. “I’ve seen a lot of talk about getting used to conditions but you’ve got to remember I’ve played a lot of cricket in England before, so the conditions aren’t really new to me. I’m just keen to play some cricket.” ,  Belarusian comes from set down to beat Sherif 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 Karatsev knocks out Medvedev and Alcaraz routs Zverev The world No 2, Aryna Sabalenka, denied the unseeded Egyptian Mayar Sherif the biggest victory of her career when the Belarusian came back from a set down to win their Madrid Open quarter-final 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 on Tuesday. Sabalenka was not at her best and made 37 unforced errors in the match, but the Australian Open champion bounced back midway through the second set to win 10 games in a row and take control. Sherif, who has won only one WTA 250 title in her career, was gifted the first game of the match, winning all her points through unforced errors from Sabalenka to break the Belarusian before building a 3-1 lead. , Hidden camera at slaughterhouse appears to show ‘utterly inhumane’ use of CO2 to stun pigs before slaughter New undercover footage showing British pigs being gassed prior to slaughter has led to renewed calls to investigate the use of CO2. Campaigners say the pictures – the first of their kind to be obtained in a UK abattoir – show the “utterly inhumane” nature of using CO2 to stun pigs before being killed. But the pork industry says its use is recognised as the most welfare-friendly method available, and says alternatives are being sought. , Survey finds exhaustion and low morale among school nurses as they face increasingly complex caseloads  School nurses’ crucial, underfunded role The UK needs at least 11,000 more school nurses to deal with the increasingly complex needs of young people after the pandemic, and help prevent them from developing serious mental health problems, researchers and campaigners say. The number of school nurses has fallen by 35% in the last five years to about 2,000, and research by Oxford Brookes University, the University of Birmingham and the Oxford Health NHS foundation trust has found that a lack of long-term investment has resulted in many local areas scrapping the roles altogether. , College of Policing, covering England and Wales, looking at the crime after study shows 25% of offenders go on to carry out serious attacks Police are to formally review whether they should take indecent exposure more seriously amid emerging evidence that people who commit such crimes can escalate their offending, the Guardian has learned. It comes after it was revealed Wayne Couzens, the then-Metropolitan police officer who raped and murdered Sarah Everard, had committed a series of offences where he had exposed himself before the murder. Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html , The Stand comedy club said key operational staff were unwilling to work with Joanna Cherry  UK politics live – latest updates One of the Edinburgh festival fringe’s most popular venues could be at risk of legal action, lawyers have said, after staff refused to work at an event with the SNP MP Joanna Cherry. The MP, who has been outspoken in her opposition to self-identification for transgender people, told the Guardian she was “considering her options” but that she would prefer to resolve the issue privately.The Stand comedy club said Cherry’s planned appearance during the festival fringe in August had been cancelled because “key operational staff” were unwilling to work with her. , Paul Nthenge Mackenzie faces charges of terrorism, murder, kidnapping and cruelty towards children A Kenyan religious cult leader accused of inciting followers to starve to death is facing additional charges including terrorism and child trafficking. Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie, who set up the Good News International Church in 2003, appeared in court in Malindi on Tuesday. , Group has removed AI images used to promote their reports on social media, including fake photos of Colombia’s 2021 protests While the systemic brutality used by Colombian police to quell national protests in 2021 was real and is well documented, photos recently used by Amnesty International to highlight the issue were not. The international human rights advocacy group has come under fire for posting images generated by artificial intelligence in order to promote their reports on social media – and has since removed them. , Mohamed Khairullah, mayor of a New Jersey town, says he’s on list ‘that has targeted me because of my identity’ The US Secret Service denied security clearance for Mohamed Khairullah, the longest-serving Muslim mayor in New Jersey, and prevented him from attending a White House Eid al-Fitr event on Monday afternoon marking the end of Ramadan. Khairullah, who was critical of the Trump administration’s travel ban in 2017 that restricted entry to the United States from several predominantly Muslim countries, received the call from the Secret Service while he was en route to the White House. President Joe Biden revoked that ban in 2021. , Sex scene in Bruno Le Maire’s book provokes ridicule and anger among opposition politicians An explicit sex scene in a newly published novel by the French economy minister has left the government facing fresh accusations it is not listening to the concerns of the country just as it tries to contain anger over the unpopular rise in the pension age. The toe-curling sexual descriptions in the novel, Fugue Américaine, written by the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, have angered opposition politicians and inspired anti-government slogans and graffiti at street demonstrations as the government struggles to contain the political crisis over Emmanuel Macron raising the minimum pension age to 64. , Ommeren became hive of activity after Dutch National Archive unveiled map featuring a red ‘X’ in January A Dutch village that became the focus of a frenzied treasure hunt after a map allegedly showed Nazi loot buried there during the second world war has declared the search over – and said nothing was found. The small hamlet of Ommeren did conclude that there had indeed been treasure buried there, but that it was removed after the war. , Flake and Crunchie chocolate products among those potentially contaminated with bacteria Six Cadbury-branded desserts including Flake and Crunchie chocolate desserts have been recalled by their manufacturer over fears they could be contaminated with listeria. The dairy company Müller, which produces the desserts, said it was recalling various batches in the UK and Ireland as a precaution, all of which have a use-by date of either 17 or 18 May. , Federal complaint alleges Jackie Little, who had a ‘known history of arson or suspect arson’, started fires at two mosques US authorities have arrested a man accused of setting fires at two Minneapolis mosques last week and charged him with arson, an act that the city’s police chief described as a “hate crime” aimed at instilling fear in the local Muslim community. A federal complaint alleged that Jackie Little, 36, entered the Masjid Omar Islamic Center on 23 April wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and a blue medical mask and lit a cardboard box on fire in the center’s second-floor bathroom. An employee reportedly chased Little out of the location. , The Killing Eve star is in competition for best actress, while musical Some Like It Hot picks up the most nominations overall, with 13 Jodie Comer has been nominated for a Tony award for her debut performance on Broadway in Prima Facie. The Killing Eve star won best actress at the Olivier awards in London for the one-woman play, which transferred to New York in April. It stars Comer as a barrister who defends men charged with rape who is then assaulted herself. In the best actress category, Comer is up against Audra McDonald (Ohio State Murders), who has won more Tony awards than any other performer; Jessica Hecht (Summer, 1976) and Jessica Chastain, recognised for her performance in A Doll’s House, which opened on Broadway in March after its London run was scuppered by Covid. , Brace, who has died aged 43, was a hugely talented playwright, dramaturg and director who worked on a string of hits including One-Woman Show and Age Is a Feeling “The most high-profile director you’ve never heard of.” That’s what the Stage newspaper called Adam Brace late last year, after an annus mirabilis in which he seemingly worked on every great performance I watched. Liz Kingsman’s breakout hit One-Woman Show – that pitch-perfect parody of the Fleabag phenomenon – was one. Haley McGee’s for-the-ages solo show about the shape of our lives, Age Is a Feeling, was another. Throw in Leo Reich’s blazing standup debut, Sh!t Theatre’s Evita Too – and the London revival of Alex Edelman’s off-Broadway hit Just for Us – and you’ve got a man who took the idea of the magic touch to stratospheric levels. This, then, was a director-dramaturg with the world at his feet, and his death at the age of 43 is a colossal loss. In that Venn diagram where creative comedy meets compelling theatre – where, let’s face it, all the best work is made – his name on the credits was a gold standard. All the more remarkable to think that he came late to his twin passions, directing and dramaturgy, after a perfectly successful initial stint as a playwright. His play Stovepipe was co-produced by the Bush and the National Theatre; its follow-up (his last), They Drink It in the Congo, had a run at the Almeida. , Writers Guild of America calls first work stoppage in 15 years as industry grapples with streaming boom Hollywood productions have ground to a halt after thousands of film and television writers went on strike following the breakdown of last-minute pay talks with major studios. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) called its first stoppage in 15 years after failing to reach an agreement on higher pay, pitting its 11,500 screenwriters against old-guard companies, such as Universal, Paramount and Walt Disney, as well as tech newcomers, such as Netflix, Amazon and Apple. , A new study has linked siestas of 30 minutes or more with increased BMI and blood pressure. But that doesn’t mean you should avoid a little lie down Name: Napping. Age: Ancient. Before drugs, it was all we had. , Meet four people who stitch their own garments, whether for reasons of morality or creativity  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email Like many millennials, textiles (a less 1950s name for sewing lessons) was part of the curriculum  at my high school. Those classes marked the beginning and end of any attempts to make my own clothes. But I do remember the sense of satisfaction that came with using the overlocker and iron to finish a project: magically turning something crumpled and lumpy into a crisp (if misshapen) garment. This week, I spoke to four people whose creativity, patience and skillset deepened beyond their early years, allowing them to make their own clothes to this day. , With numbers of volunteers in England at a historic low, we would like to hear from people who have quit about their reasons why With numbers of volunteers in England at a historic low, we would like to hear from people who have quit about their reasons why. According to the Time Well Spent 2023 report from National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), those raising money or taking part in sponsored events fell by 48% since 2018. The report also found that those organising or helping to run an activity has fallen by 52%, from 14% to 7%. , Jamie Dimon says this phase of bank collapses is over, but ‘other cracks in the system’ could still be revealed Fresh from the rescue of First Republic, the latest US regional bank to go under, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has been talking down the threat of contagion. He claims the domino effect that started with Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and was quickly followed by Signature Bank, Credit Suisse, and now First Republic, is coming to an end. “There may be another smaller one, but this pretty much resolves them all,” Dimon told analysts on Monday. “This part of the crisis is over.” , Steve Barclay urges RCN and Unite to call off further strikes after health unions representing majority of NHS workers accept pay offer Momentum, the Labour group set up to promote Jeremy Corbyn’s agenda when he was party leader, claims that Keir Starmer could end up like Nick Clegg if he abandons his promise to abolish tuition fees. Responding to what Starmer said on this this morning (see 9.01am), Momentum spokesperson said: This move wouldn’t just fly in the face of party democracy and the wishes of Labour Students. It would be a betrayal of millions of young people in desperate need of hope. The Labour leadership should learn from Nick Clegg’s failure, not repeat it.Keir was elected on a promise to abolish tuition fees. With higher education in crisis and young people facing a future of high rents &amp;amp; even higher debts, this pledge is more urgent than ever. Trust matters. Young people matter. The results won’t make happy reading for the Conservative party, who now have minimal support among undergraduates. While they will make happier reading for Labour, it is clear there is no single student funding model that would be overwhelmingly popular with students. This will make the opposition’s job harder as they firm up their policies in the run-up to the next [general] election. , Kremlin disputes White House figures showing Russian casualties mark an acceleration even when compared with first days of the war  Russia-Ukraine war at a glance Reuters has a quick snap to say that all parties in the Black Sea grain initiative will meet for talks on Wednesday, according to a senior Ukrainian source. The deal is, according to Russia’s timetable, due to expire on 18 May. The Kremlin has been lukewarm about the prospect of it being extended, arguing that restrictions on Russia’s banking and insurance sector have damaged the country’s own agricultural exports. Our state has already proven that it can win. We have proven that we can liberate our land from the occupier. All those who ensure the de-occupation have proven that, together with the blue and yellow flag, normal life returns for every person and every family. Our goal is to return this life to the whole of Ukraine, to all those areas that are still temporarily under occupation. , Nationwide reports that UK house prices shows ‘signs of stabilisation’ in April, rising unexpectedly by 0.5%  UK supermarkets face calls for ‘profiteering’ investigation as inflation soars Bumper BP profits reignite debate over tougher windfall tax Shares in UK housebuilders have jumped this morning, after Nationwide reported an unexpected increase in UK house prices last month. Persimmon are up 5.8% in early trading, with Barratt Development (+2.5%) and Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%) and Berkeley Group (+2%) also in the top FTSE 100 risers. “Today’s heinous profits from BP are another kick in the teeth to the millions of people who can’t afford to heat their homes. BP has also quietly lowered its already weak climate targets, leaving us all to suffer even more from their climate damages whilst they line their pockets in a cost-of-living crisis. , Greg Abbott rows back on ‘inhumane’ remarks amid barrage of criticism after shooting that killed five, including a child After a barrage of public criticism from immigration advocates, Latino state lawmakers and Congress members, Texas’s Republican governor Greg Abbott has backtracked from controversial remarks he made referring to the victims of a recent mass murder as “illegal immigrants”. “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and our hearts go out to the families who have lost a loved one,” Renae Eze, a spokesperson for Abbott, told ABC News in a statement about those slain in a shooting in Cleveland, Texas, on Friday night. “Federal officials provided the state of Texas information on the criminal and the victims, including that they were in the country illegally. We’ve since learned that at least one of the victims may have been in the United States legally.” , Russian casualties mark an acceleration even when compared with first days of the war, says White House as Kremlin disputes figures  Russia-Ukraine war at a glance Reuters has a quick snap to say that all parties in the Black Sea grain initiative will meet for talks on Wednesday, according to a senior Ukrainian source.

Now, he’s part of a national effort to slash Britain’s energy use in the face of bills sent soaring by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting concerns about gas and electricity supplies. Despite having collected a total of more than £30m in cumulative pay and benefits in his time as chief executive of National Grid, Pettigrew has not forgotten his parents’ advice. “I’m the same with my family now – making sure the thermostat is turned down a few degrees, doing the sensible things,” he says. “It is the right thing to do from an environmental [and] an affordability perspective. We were very supportive of the government and other bodies advocating for people to do that.” , Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin expected to testify that columnist told them about alleged assault shortly after it happened in 1996 Jurors in E Jean Carroll’s legal action against Donald Trump for alleged rape and defamation are expected to begin hearing on Tuesday from two women who say they can back key parts of the advice columnist’s account. Carroll wrapped up three days on the witness stand on Monday as the judge in the civil case, Lewis Kaplan, denied a defense motion for a mistrial on the grounds that he had made “pervasive unfair and prejudicial rulings” against Trump’s team during its cross-examination of the former president’s accuser. , I had paid £175, the seller had disappeared and I co-operated with police but it says it can’t help At the end of last year I bought a laptop on eBay that was being sold by a third-party seller. In February the Metropolitan police emailed me to inform me the laptop had been stolen from the NHS. I returned it, as per its instructions, about 10 days later. I called eBay to obtain a refund, assuming fraudulent activity would be covered by its money-back guarantee. The seller had, by this time, disappeared from the site. , 'There's absolute secrecy​ ...​ the doctors ​I'm speaking to ​say they are being threatened from revealing test results or in many cases ​not being allowed to ​test schoolgirls​ who fear they have been poisoned.'

Email feast@theguardian.com Every Guardian recipe begins with “boil the vegetable(s)”. We always steam, believing more nutrients and flavour stay in  that way, so why are we out of step with your writers?Malcolm, NorwichRight, let’s round up some of the Guardian’s food crew and ask them to explain themselves. First to take the stand is Meera Sodha. “I’m not the sort of person to optimise anything in life, except for pleasure and ease,” she says, so when it comes to vegetables, her answer is easy: “If I’m cooking them into a meal [a curry or pan-fried dish, say], I’ll just put them in the pot or pan with all the other ingredients, where they might cook by frying, simmering or, if there’s a lid involved, part-steaming – I suppose the nutrients are captive then, so that’s a bonus!” If, however, she is serving a side of, for instance, broccoli, she’ll boil it, “because it’s quick, efficient and hands-off, which is important to me, especially if there’s something else on the bubble.” And while Sodha concedes that she could steam (“It just involves a colander and lid, after all”), she won’t be changing her ways any time soon. “I like to get to something as delicious as possible with the least amount of fuss, so boiling will always win.” For our resident perfectionist Felicity Cloake, however, the cooking method she chooses depends on what she’s making. “I steam if the vegetable is going on the plate naked with salt and oil, because I prefer the texture. But if I was adding it to another dish, I’d blanch rather than boil, because it’s more efficient.” Nutrients-wise, Cloake doesn’t have a policy: “If there are vegetables in there, I’m generally thinking nutrients are happening anyway. Although it’s obviously something to consider, and I will in future, so thank you, Malcolm.” Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com , While Suella Braverman stokes fears about new arrivals, officials tell villagers in Essex a different story. Who should they listen to? On Friday evening, Wethersfield village hall in north Essex was packed with concerned local residents firing questions at Home Office officials about the potential imminent arrival of hundreds of asylum seekers. A military airfield close to the picturesque and remote village has been earmarked by the Home Office to accommodate up to 1,700 asylum seekers as an alternative to hotel use. At the meeting, one resident asked attendees who were opposed to the plans to stand up. All 160 locals in the room leapt to their feet. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

at a Barcelona restaurant were left amazed when a mysterious last-minute booking turned out to be for the former US president Barack Obama along with film director Steven Spielberg and singer Bruce Springsteen. After dining on Thursday evening at the Palace Hotel’s Amar restaurant, the trio posed for a photograph with employees. The picture was posted on Instagram by staff member Pol Perello and captioned: “Pleasures that this job brings you!!” ,  Qatari banker offers around £5bn for 100% of club Interested parties needed to make offers by 10pm BST on Friday Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have lodged final bids for Manchester United by Friday’s 10pm BST deadline. The offers are markedly less than the £6bn valuation of the club’s owners, the Glazers. Sheikh Jassim, a Qatari banker, remains intent on purchasing 100% of the club but will not pay more than what he believes United are worth. The Guardian understands this is around £5bn, roughly £1bn below the American family’s asking price. ,  Si leads 14-10 after one of the best sessions ever seen Mark Selby leads Mark Allen 7-6 in gruelling semi-final Luca Brecel staged a brave fightback to stay in his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Si Jiahui in one of the most exciting sessions witnessed at the Crucible. The Chinese world No 80, who has wowed fans over the last two weeks with his brilliant attacking game, looked on course to win the match with a session to spare when he won the first three frames of the evening session, extending his lead from 11-5 to 14-5 with breaks of 90, 132 and 97. ,  Bochum 1-1 Borussia Dortmund Bayern Munich will go top if they beat Hertha Berlin on Sunday The Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund’s title chances suffered a serious blow on Friday after they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at struggling Bochum. Dortmund are on 61 points with four matches remaining, two points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich, who will move top if they beat bottom club Hertha Berlin on Sunday. , Colombian author’s En Agosto Now Vemos (We’ll See Each Other in August) had been just a rumour but now fans will get to read it Rumours had long circulated that an entire literary masterpiece, never seen by the public, could still be lying in a dusty safe held by the late author’s family or under lock and key at his archive at the University of Texas. On Friday Penguin Random House confirmed that an unpublished Gabriel García Márquez novel – titled En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We’ll See Each Other in August) – not only exists, but will be on shelves across Latin America in 2024. , Tree design includes names of Commonwealth nations, and poles are made from tree from Windsor estate The king and the queen consort will be anointed behind a specially created screen of fine embroidery, held by poles hewn from an ancient windblown Windsor oak and mounted with eagles cast in bronze and gilded in gold leaf, Buckingham Palace has announced. The anointing screen has been blessed at a special service at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, and will be used at what historically has been viewed as the most sacred moment of the coronation. , Wikimedia UK says it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill Wikipedia could be made inaccessible to UK readers due to issues over complying with the online safety bill, a charity affiliated with the website has warned. Lucy Crompton-Reid, the chief executive of Wikimedia UK, warned the popular site could be blocked because it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill. , Scotland’s Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has been asked to look into the killing of Glasgow teacher  Scotland’s police watchdog has been ordered to launch an investigation into the murder of a pregnant teacher in Glasgow after finding the body of her fiance in a reservoir days later. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said it had been instructed to carry out the probe after the death of Marelle Sturrock, who was found at her home on Tuesday. , The former striker discusses visiting hospitals in his homeland, his push to raise funds and Champions League hopes for Milan “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. , Forty-year-old festival sees chefs use power tools to mix the eggs before a fork lift hoists the enormous frying pan into place Using 8,400 eggs, 25kg of venison sausage and 14 bottles of salt and pepper, New Caledonia’s giant omelette festival aims to bring people together in a region that is often divided. “It is important to have festivals like this. The giant omelette is a symbol of sharing,” says veteran chef Reine Chenot. , Twickenham is expected to host over 53,000 fans as England’s departing head coach aims to end with glory against France After eight years, 85 Tests, 76 wins and 3,411 points scored, England’s head coach Simon Middleton takes charge of his final match on Saturday. It should be quite a finale, with a world-record crowd for a women’s game in excess of 53,000 expected at Twickenham as the Red Roses go head-to-head with France in a winner-takes-all Six Nations decider. The record currently stands at 42,579, set at the World Cup final at Eden Park in November. The attendance is also sure to smash the current Women’s Six Nations record, set last weekend with 18,604 watching France v Wales at the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. , In the best traditions of Fergie-time, substitute Millie Turner headed home the latest possible winning goal to help Manchester United stretch their lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to six points. The centre-back converted Katie Zelem’s much-disputed free-kick three minutes into added time to keep United’s dreams of a league and FA Cup double alive. , Different reports fly around while Fox News declines to comment on the cancellation of top TV host’s show The exact reason behind the rightwing TV host Tucker Carlson’s abrupt firing from Fox News remains unclear, days after the star’s show was suddenly cancelled. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Carlson was fired after executives discovered vulgar text messages, including one in which he called a top executive the C-word. There were also concerns among Fox management that Carlson was acting as if he was above the network, the Journal reported. , UN’s arbitrary detention group calls for immediate release of Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, saying detention has no basis in law A UN body has declared that the detention of a long-term Guantánamo inmate, Abu Zubaydah, has no lawful basis and called for his immediate release, warning that the systemic deprivation of liberty at the camp may “constitute crimes against humanity”. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD), also declared the UK, among other countries, was “jointly responsible for the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of Mr Zubaydah” over his more than 20 years in detention. , US supreme court justice, who wrote Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, denies claims he was responsible for leak in draft form Samuel Alito said the decision he wrote removing the federal right to abortion made him and other US supreme court justices “targets of assassination” but denied claims he was responsible for its leak in draft form. “Those of us who were thought to be in the majority, thought to have approved my draft opinion, were really targets of assassination,” Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. , Yemeni authorities said ‘suspicious’ and unresponsive ship opened fire, while ship manager reports clash with pirates Armed guards aboard a yacht once owned by the late Welsh actor Richard Burton have fired on approaching ships in the Gulf of Aden, prompting an intense gunfight. Yemeni authorities said the guards mistakenly opened fire on a Coast Guard vessel but the ship’s manager insisted they had clashed with pirates. The shooting reportedly killed one Yemeni Coast Guard member and wounded another person in a hail of gunfire – the guards are said to have shot as many as 200 rounds of ammunition. The incident shows the danger faced by both shippers and security forces in the waters off the Arab world’s poorest country, even as it remains crucial for global commerce. , Crowning of King Charles expected to pass quietly in New Zealand, though there is still some fascination with the crown In town halls and social media groups, New Zealand’s most committed royalists are planning high teas, concerts, and watching parties. For the most dedicated, the memorabilia will be out on display: tea sets and replica tiaras, lifetime collections of Woman’s Weekly front pages and special edition photo books. For others, however – including some of the country’s dedicated royal watchers – the coronation cupcakes and cucumber sandwiches come with a side of doubt, over the future of the monarchy and the changing way that it is viewed in colonised countries. Elizabeth Garlick will watch the coronation live, late into the night, with a group of other royal fans who are planning wine, cheese, and possibly tiaras. She says she fell in love with the royals as a small child, seeing princess Diana in the news, and over time became a “royal watcher” – keeping track of major events in the monarchy’s timeline. “I grew up in a family of other royal watchers – my great aunties, my great nana has [the queen’s] coronation on vinyl,” she says. “For me, this is like a once in a lifetime – a historical moment.” , Evacuations from Sudan, battle raging in Bakhmut, protests against a judicial overhaul in Israel and climate activism in Berlin: the most striking images this week , Government announces end to airlifts amid calls for NHS doctors without UK passports to be rescued British nationals trapped in Sudan have until midday on Saturday local time to get on a flight before they stop, ministers have announced, as a doctors’ union called for NHS medics without UK passports to also be airlifted. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Friday night more than 1,500 people had been flown out, and there had been a “significant decline in British nationals coming forward”, meaning it was time to end the operation. , Four main teaching unions could unite after ‘months of stonewalling’ from education secretary Gillian Keegan All state schools in England could be closed by “unprecedented” coordinated strikes involving all four teaching unions, after their leaders vowed to increase pressure on the government to improve its pay offer. In a joint press conference, the leaders of the four major education unions said they wanted to send a message to the education secretary that she needed to resume negotiations over pay and school funding. , The Conservative party has been too involved in the debasement of public life for too long to be entrusted with its rehabilitation The advertisement for the job of BBC chair for which Richard Sharp successfully applied in November 2020, and from which he resigned on Friday, stipulated that candidates declare any “real or perceived conflict of interest”. Care should be taken over issues that could “be misconstrued, cause embarrassment, or cause public confidence in the appointment to be jeopardised”. One such issue, in Mr Sharp’s case, was helping facilitate guarantees for a personal loan of up to £800,000 from a Canadian financier to Boris Johnson, then prime minister. When asked by the advisory assessment panel that gave the green light for his appointment about perceived conflicts of interest, Mr Sharp said everything had been properly declared. It had not. A report into the process, published on Friday, found that omission to be an unambiguous breach of the rules. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. , Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach has declared that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, has said that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings. But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration. Mr Loach is 86 and Mr Auerbach is 92 on Saturday, and they are still working. For all the challenges of age that both report, they continue to command the heights of their respective vocations – as does another great 92-year‑old artist Bridget Riley, who is about to unveil her first ceiling painting at the British School in Rome. , Conservative party accused of undermining broadcaster by flooding it with cronies after chair’s resignation Rishi Sunak is under pressure to stop appointing Conservatives to key positions at the BBC after Richard Sharp’s resignation prompted criticism the party had undermined the broadcaster by flooding it with cronies. Sharp quit as BBC chair on Friday morning after an investigation concluded he had failed to disclose key information about his relationship with the former prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job in 2021. Sharp helped facilitate an £800,000 loan guarantee for Johnson when he was in the running to take over the broadcaster but did not tell the appointments panel. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter and child cruelty by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , Record heat in southern Europe and chilly start to British growing season spell more misery for shoppers Shoppers have been warned they face more fruit and vegetable shortages, as temperatures in southern Spain soar to unprecedented levels while the UK growing season gets off to a late start because of cold, overcast weather. Temperatures were expected to reach a new April record of 39C (102F) in parts of Andalucía on Friday amid a long-lasting drought that has affected the production of vegetables in Spain. Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday. , Submarine rescue vessel SS-750 was photographed in Baltic four days before still-unexplained explosions, says Danish newspaper A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just prior to the mysterious September blasts, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage confirmed the existence of the hitherto publicly unknown photographs. , South African magnate hopes there will be bidder in auction who prefers 1,993 rare creatures to a superyacht Wanted: an animal-loving billionaire who might consider buying 1,993 threatened white rhinos instead of a new superyacht or a Picasso, or a Picasso onboard a superyacht. John Hume, a South African multimillionaire who started a rhino breeding project with about 200 animals 30 years ago, is selling all the rhinos and the 8,500-hectare (21,000 acres) conservation ranch where they live in what must rank as one of the most unusual ever online auctions. , Council’s preparations are under way but excitement is muted and some say they are unlikely to watch Chris Booth spent much of Tuesday morning supervising the installation of a crown 4.2 metres wide on the stone columns at the front of Nottingham’s Council House. The crown had been brought out of a council depot (where it is stored alongside a vast goose that appears annually for the Nottingham goose fair), repainted and had had its plastic pearls retrofitted with LED bulbs so they can be lit up at night. , Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets. Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in Avengers: Infinity War but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone). , Current science suggests that chrono-activity or adjusting our regimes to suit our body clocks, plus short, sharp workouts, are the key to a beneficial exercise routine Thousands of us have started 2023 with new exercise programmes promising to get us fit, muscle-bound and slim. But the latest science of chrono-exercise (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it. Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym. ,  Max Verstappen will start second on grid for Sunday’s race Hamilton fifth but Russell 11th after disappointing Q2 After a frustrating and stultifying opening to the new Formula One season, Ferrari finally have a moment to savour. How much it meant was clear as Charles Leclerc climbed from his car having taken pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and vigorously pointed to the prancing horse logo on his chest. Pumped by an immaculate performance, he and the Scuderia will view this as the belated opening to 2023 they wanted – but what follows this weekend will more accurately define the scale of their challenge to a dominant Red Bull. Leclerc has taken a battering in the opening three races. He suffered an engine failure in Bahrain, a 10-place grid penalty in Saudi Arabia and was unlucky to be punted out of the race on the first lap in Australia. After a week in which he has had to dismiss rumours of talks with Mercedes to join the team should Lewis Hamilton retire, and in which it was announced that Ferrari’s racing director, Laurent Mekies, is to leave to replace Franz Tost as team principal at AlphaTauri – a blow after the recent loss of technical director David Sanchez to McLaren – Leclerc delivered reason for the embattled team to finally breathe out. ,  Former England captain was strategic adviser to the ECB T20 could have two divisions and 18 teams Andrew Strauss has left his roles as strategic adviser to the England and Wales Cricket Board and chair of the performance cricket committee only three weeks after the changes to the structure of domestic cricket he recommended in last year’s high performance review were declared “dead in the water” by Richard Gould, the governing body’s chief executive. The announcement came on the day it emerged that the men’s Hundred could be abandoned in favour of a new Twenty20 competition, with the ECB said to be concerned the new format has failed to catch on internationally and was not as appealing to the cream of international talent as the widely played alternative. ,  French Open finalist’s struggles continue on clay ATP announces live electronic line calling across Tour One of the greatest challenges of being a top tennis player is remaining one, year after year, even as the rest of the field conspires to tear you down. In the first few months of his sophomore season among the elite, Casper Ruud continues to exemplify that struggle. Ruud, the French Open runner up last year, suffered another early loss on clay, losing 6-3, 6-4 to young Italian Matteo Arnaldi in the second round of the Madrid Open. A year ago, Ruud had reached the fourth round of a grand slam only once. Although he was already a top 10 player, he had a reputation for specialising in clay and thriving in the smaller events. The Norwegian blew every expectation out of the water in his breakthrough season, reaching finals at the French Open, US Open, ATP Finals and Miami Open. A match away from the top spot in New York, he finished the season having reached a career high ranking of No 2. , This debacle brought together a foolish man and a dishonest prime minister, but it also highlights the urgent need for systemic reform A word of advice for anyone who has worked hard to acquire a reputation they cherish: if Boris Johnson approaches, if he comes anywhere near, run a mile. Richard Sharp is the latest proof that, even out of office, Johnson continues to act as reputational napalm, laying waste to careers and turning good names bad. Sharp joins a long list that includes Christopher Geidt, who had the poison task of serving as Johnson’s adviser on ethics; Allegra Stratton, whom the former prime minister said had “sickened” him when she joked about a party in Downing Street, even though he had attended several himself; and the one-time rising star civil servant and current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, quoted this week as having said of Johnson, “I don’t know what more I can do to stand up to a prime minister who lies”. Each entered Johnson’s circle as a respected figure; each was diminished by their contact with the reverse Midas, the man who rots everything he touches. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist , Readers respond to Emma Beddington’s article about the embarrassment she felt at the state of the country when her French in-laws came to visit Emma Beddington writes about being embarrassed by the state of Britain when her French in-laws visited, citing various ways in which the country compares poorly with France (I saw the UK through the eyes of my French in-laws – and it was deeply embarrassing, 23 April). But she ends on a positive note, describing how her in-laws were impressed on a train when they saw “a lovely group of women sitting next to us in Hawaiian garlands, enjoying prosecco at 8am”. If that is the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s not much. I can understand Beddington’s “countrybarrassment”. Especially because there is no other country I have been so much in love with as Britain. For some 60 years, I travelled its length and breath, reading its literature, enjoying its arts. Its people were always welcoming – at least, that is what I thought, and I still think that most of the time the friendliness is sincere. , Readers lament the damage to culture resulting from the government cutting funding Sir Simon Rattle is right to voice his anxiety about the state of classical music in the UK (Simon Rattle is right: Britain is becoming a cultural desert – and that’s a political choice, 26 April). He is concerned for the future of orchestras, opera houses and large choirs as public financial subsidies dry up. I am the secretary of a very small concert-promoting society in north Hertfordshire. We too have lost local authority support, but even more concerning is the diminishing size of our audiences. , Garden charity no longer categorises slugs and snails as pests but sells items that harm them, say critics The Royal Horticultural Society has been criticised for continuing to sell products that kill wildflowers and insects, despite public messaging about protecting biodiversity. Last year, the RHS said slugs and snails would no longer be classed as pests. The leading garden charity said they were an important part of the garden ecosystem and “play an important role in planet-friendly gardening”. , Vaughn Dolphin, from Walsall, West Midlands, had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot A far-right extremist who accidentally set off a “fireball” in his own kitchen while experimenting with explosives has been convicted of terrorism offences. Vaughn Dolphin, who had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot, was found guilty on a series of charges after a jury viewed videos and incriminating conversations on social media. , With dwindling real-terms pay still a sore point, Whitehall staff feel the  Raab bullying case has only unleashed more hostility “Almost every civil servant I talk to is looking for a way out,” says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now an expert on Whitehall. It’s hardly a surprise after the past few years: civil servants have been demonised as workshy by former Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, blamed for the Partygate scandal by Boris Johnson and threatened with 91,000 job cuts. , Decision welcomed by victim after judge decided not to jail Sean Hogg from South Lanarkshire for the offence A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , Upmarket homewares and clothing retailer sees pretax profits rise 18% in post-lockdown recovery The family behind The White Company have given themselves at least £50m in payments as the upmarket homewares and clothing brand bounces back from the pandemic lockdowns. The company paid a £50m dividend to an entity controlled by the founder, Chrissie Rucker, and her husband, Nicholas Wheeler, the founder of the shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt. The group’s highest paid director, thought to be Rucker, took a further £5m in pay, up from £675,000 a year before, as a long-term bonus plan cashed in. , Woman and child die in Dnipro, while missile strikes in Uman, south of Kyiv, kill 19  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 19 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. , Nation’s guidelines say no donor should father more than 25 children in 12 families Dutch judges have ordered a man suspected of fathering more than 550 children through sperm donations to stop donating, in the latest fertility scandal to shock the Netherlands. The man, identified in Dutch media only as Jonathan M, 41, was taken to court by a foundation protecting the rights of donor children and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. , Rapporteurs also chastise the German and Namibian governments for excluding Herero and Nama minorities from talks dealing with the mass murder of their ancestors UN special rapporteurs have criticised the German and Namibian governments for violating the rights of Herero and Nama ethnic minorities by excluding them from talks over reparations for colonial crimes against their ancestors. Publishing their communication with both governments, the seven UN representatives urged Germany to take responsibility for all its colonial crimes in Namibia – including mass murder – and said it was wrong for the Herero and Nama to have been involved indirectly in talks via an advisory committee. They called on Germany to pay reparations directly to the Herero and Nama and not to the Namibian government. , Ricot Jean found dead after reportedly being kidnapped and Dumesky Kersaint reportedly killed by a stray bullet Two more journalists have been killed in Haiti in the past month as rampant gang violence has gripped the capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Ricot Jean, who worked for Radio-Tele Evolution Inter was found dead on Tuesday, a day after he was reportedly kidnapped by men wearing police uniforms. Jean was a prominent cultural activist in the Haitian capital and hosted a weekly radio show. , Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandalsFor the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films. This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other. , The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work • James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599 Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”. In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.” , Authors, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month. Join the conversation in the comments In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they have been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a memoir that wrestles with singleness, poetry that feels alive and excellent audiobooks. Tell us in the comments what you have been reading. *** , A lager-and-lime slushie (with orange and lemon) that’s very popular in south-east Asia Jelly beer is a popular Thai alcoholic slushie that’s made in a bia wun (oscillating) machine that’s filled with ice, salt, water and beer bottles and that rocks constantly as it cools the beer – usually Singha or Chang – down to -3C. The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added. This ginger, honey and citrus take on the idea involves a blender rather than a bia wun, and uses orange and lime juice instead of the more traditional calamansi juice. It’s a great refreshing drink to welcome the first warm days of spring – and to keep up your sleeve for the hotter months to come. Luke Farrell, Speedboat Bar, London W1 , On her travels Petrina Darrah would often send her mother photographs, then receive a picture of the same place three decades earlier in return  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email When I told my mum I was taking my younger sister to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she could barely contain her excitement. Thirty years before we set foot in Goma, our mother arrived in the same city on a dusty Bedford truck that had carted a swag of lanky youths all the way from London. Back then, the DRC was called Zaire and civil war had yet to tear the region apart. Mum remembers Goma as being quite cosmopolitan. , Fox News settlement seen as ‘moment of weakness’ that puts focus on  mogul’s heirs and their future “Rupert has shown a rare sign of weakness,” says one longtime Murdoch watcher. “There is something of the smell of blood in the water.” In the space of two weeks the 92-year-old’s media empire has taken a reputational hammering on both sides of the Atlantic, putting a renewed focus on the future shape of the global conglomerate’s businesses – and who will run them. , At Omdurman’s open-air market, half of the stalls are shut, customers are scarce and money is tight “I haven’t sold anything since 6am today,” said Adam Musa, a vegetable seller at Omdurman’s open-air market, as fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces raged a few miles away. “There are no people buying.” Musa, 55, faced two problems: a lack of customers, and an inability on the part of those who did come to pay what he was charging. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine.

In the end the Welsh side prevailed, to the relief of their fans and Hollywood owners, consigning Notts County to the playoffs. In National League South, Ebbsfleet had no need to look over their shoulder as they hit the 100-point mark with one game remaining. The Kent side secured the title with four games to spare and sit 18 points clear of their nearest rivals, Dartford. Ebbsfleet’s march to promotion was masterminded by Dennis Kutrieb, a highly regarded young German who took over at the Stonebridge Road in June 2020, three months after the National League season was halted by the pandemic. Ebbsfleet were relegated by 0.002 of a point when clubs agreed to end the season on a points-per-game basis but have finally booked their return to the fifth tier. , The selection attempts to become only the second horse to follow up a Scottish Grand National victory at Sandown Kitty’s Light would be a hugely popular winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup on Jumps Finale day at Sandown on Saturday, and Christian Williams, his trainer, believes the seven-year-old has the right attitude and constitution to follow up his success in the Scottish Grand National last weekend. “He’s freakish for a horse,” Williams said this week. “The way he comes out of his races, you’ll never have seen anything like it. Basically, you could nearly run him in the next race as he recovers so quickly, so there’s something inside him. I’m not sure if he’s got big lungs or a big heart but there’s something in him that’s different to any other horses that we’ve run.” ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email A Tennesee lawmaker who was previously outsted for calling for gun control after a Nashville mass shooting has spoken about Zephyr being silenced. In an interview with Democracy Now, Tennessee representative Justin Jones spoke with Zephyr about the need for continued solidarity. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , PM tells Scottish Tory conference that Holyrood should instead be ‘held to account’ for not using existing powers enough Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Its producer Aaron Dessner explains how they made it For Ed Sheeran, the release of a new album usually means a confident sweep to No 1 and steady dominance of the Top 40 over the subsequent months. But there is more at stake than usual for the 32-year-old songwriter when he releases his fifth album, – (Subtract), next Friday (5 May). The record documents a series of events last spring that Sheeran has characterised as the most challenging period in his life. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a tumour that couldn’t be operated on until after the birth of their second child. His best friend, music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, died aged 31 after taking cocaine. Sheeran was also subject to a high-profile UK court case in which he faced claims he had copied a pair of songwriters’ work in his 2017 smash hit single Shape of You. , New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff. The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT announced fresh action. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp.

I recommend baking them in heavily buttered muffin tins or silicone moulds; baker Julia Aden recently recommended putting a round piece of greaseproof paper in the base of each mould to help remove small cakes, and it works a treat. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Their justification? That Zephyr’s interaction with protesters who were demonstrating against her earlier silencing by the House’s Republican majority amounted to “encouraging an insurrection.” The Associated Press reports that such claims have become increasingly common in recent months in state legislatures where Republicans rule. Case in point, the rhetoric used by GOP lawmakers to briefly expel two Democrats from the Tennessee state House of Representatives earlier this month. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing.

On three different days last summer, visitors at a beach on the lake discovered skeletal remains along the shoreline. The Clark county coroner’s office announced on Thursday that those remains belonged to the same person, now identified as as Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on 14 July 1998 at the age of 52. , Former England captain talks about his ‘tiring’ condition in Netflix series about his life and career  What are typical symptoms and treatments for OCD?

The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong.

His Paris catwalks featured a supermarket selling Coco “Chanel” Pops, a replica Eiffel tower and a spaceship which blasted from the ground in a blaze of smoke.

You have your own losses – and young children – to deal with I am a woman in my late 30s, married with two small children with a rewarding and demanding career. I live some hours’ drive away from where I grew up and where my mum lives. I really love my life   but I need some advice regarding my relationship with my mum. My lovely dad died last year.  He was much loved and I miss him a great deal, but he gave me so much over his lifetime that I am doing OK without him. My family has probably had more loss than most. One sister died before I was born, and another older sister in her early 30s. My mum has called the loss of my dad the hardest of all. I love her very much but I feel responsible for her and guilty that I live far away.  , On his show Carlson railed against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and apologized for Putinist aggression. None of it is new Fox News has finally broken ties with its most popular star, Tucker Carlson. His ousting has been bemoaned by some commentators, who have taken Carlson to be a rebellious anti-war populist, evading easy political characterization. But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology? In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a pro-Russia monologue urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the real enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States. … It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence. , Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have both been accused of ethics violations – and John Roberts refuses to discuss the matter with Congress It was a short letter. John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, was brief in his missive to Democratic senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence”, Roberts declined to appear before the committee to discuss disturbing recent revelations of ethics violations at the court. Congress is meant to exert checks on judicial power – to investigate or even impeach judges who abuse their office or interpret the law in ways that violate its spirit, and to affirm that the elected branches will hold more sway over policy than the appointed one. But the chief justice’s show of indifference to congressional oversight authority reflects a new reality: that there are now effectively no checks on the power of the court – at least none that Democrats have the political will to use – and that the justices can be assured that they will face no repercussions even if they act in flagrant violation of ethical standards. It seems that they intend to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race. Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation. , Tyler Dupree, James Harrison and Matty Ashton have left part-time rugby league behind and are now in line to face France  Ever heard the one about the electrician, the lifeguard and the builder who went on to represent their country? There could be as many as 15 debutants when a new-look England side takes to the field against France in Warrington on Saturday afternoon, with Shaun Wane sticking to his promise of ripping up the squad that fell short in last year’s Rugby League World Cup and integrating a younger group of players in anticipation for the next tournament in France in 2025. All of those players have their own unique stories to tell, but three in particular can scarcely believe they have reached this point. As recently as 18 months ago, Tyler Dupree and James Harrison were not even full-time Super League players, with Dupree involved in the Oldham side relegated to League 1, the sport’s lowest professional tier, and Harrison playing for Featherstone Rovers. They were released by Leeds and Bradford respectively as teenagers, told they were not good enough and, cast aside from the professional ranks, forced to go part-time. , Suella Braverman flags statutory instrument to public order bill as climate protesters renew campaign Suella Braverman is to give police the power to ban slow walking in traffic by protesters, as Just Stop Oil enters the fifth consecutive day of using the tactic in the latest phase of its climate protest campaign.

National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the figure, based on US intelligence estimates, included more than 20,000 dead, half of them from the Wagner group. Russia unleashed a fresh missile attack on Ukraine in the east, killing two people, setting off huge blazes and damaging dozens of homes and other buildings in the city of Pavlohrad. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the two deaths in his video address on Monday night. “Forty other people - women, children, men – were treated for wounds and injuries,” he said. Zelenskiy also said a 14-year-boy was killed near his school when it was hit by a bomb in the Chernihiv region, close to the Russian border. An explosion in the western region of Bryansk bordering Ukraine derailed a Russian freight train on Monday, the local governor said in a social media post. “An unidentified explosive device went off, as a result of which a locomotive of a freight train derailed,” Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram, adding that there were no casualties reported. Russian authorities say the region, which borders Ukraine and Belarus, has seen multiple attacks by pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups in the 14 months since Russia invaded. Ukrainian counterattacks have ousted Russian forces from some positions in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, but the situation remains “quite difficult”, a top Ukrainian general has said. However, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, added: “At the same time, in certain parts of the city, the enemy was counterattacked by our units and left some positions.” Syrskyi made the remarks while visiting frontline troops on Sunday, the military said. The head of the Wagner private militia renewed his appeal to Russia’s defence ministry to increase ammunition shipments to his fighters trying to seize Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin has frequently clashed with Moscow’s defence establishment over the conduct of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine and what he says is insufficient support being provided to his Wagner soldiers. In a video posted on his Telegram channel, Prigozhin said he needs at least 300 tonnes of artillery shells a day for the assault, Reuters reported. Since last summer Russia has built “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades” in the areas it controls in Ukraine as well as in its own border regions, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a statement condemning the former children’s ombudsman of Russia, Pavel Astakhov, for comments he made on Russian state TV that murdering ambassadors is “within the framework of international law”, with specific reference to Poland’s ambassador. Poland called on Russia “to ensure the safety of all diplomats in accordance with the Vienna Convention”. In Washington, House speaker Kevin McCarthy emphatically stressed his support for military aid to Ukraine on Monday, criticising Russia’s “killing of the children” and distancing himself from some in his party who oppose additional major US aid to repel the Russian invasion. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken to New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins. Ukraine’s president said the pair discussed “further cooperation on defence and humanitarian issues” and “the need for further consolidation of the countries of the Pacific region in supporting Ukraine.” , Watching sea snakes swim through water is soothing – until you remember they are real Sea snakes are, in animal form, the feeling the deep end of the pool gives you when you are a child, when suddenly you feel you are swimming at night, or when you are in bed but not totally sure the floor beneath hasn’t turned into water and sharks. And because sea snakes aren’t where they’re meant to be – everything you know tells you snakes don’t belong in the sea – the more you learn about them, the more you encounter all that you don’t know: the words are weird, you understand their meaning but can’t read their letters, they are words in a dream – or was it a nightmare? Black-banded sea kraits, a type of sea snake, hunt with yellow goatfish; in New Caledonia, they are called “stripy sweaters”. Kraits are “elapid”, which means their fangs are always erect. Sea snake lungs are almost as long as their bodies; they can breathe through their skin. Their tongues are shorter than those of land snakes: only the forked part pokes out.

Many did so in the conviction that leaving the European Union would turn Britain into a smaller, more insular place, closing off possibilities and prospects in their own lives. They feared a birthright was being lost; one which allowed them a bigger, wider sense of belonging. Seven years on, that judgment is vindicated in a report by a cross-party committee of the House of Lords. Entitled The Future UK-EU Relationship, the peers’ analysis finds that, since the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with Brussels in 2021, “post-Brexit barriers to mobility between the UK and the EU, in both directions, have had an especially significant impact on young people”. , Building a healthier, more prosperous country will mean addressing the problem of low-paid, precarious employment  What’s the best way to fix Britain’s economy? According to Labour and the Conservatives, the answer is growth. Yet this focus overlooks another fundamental reason for Britain’s sluggish productivity. The UK is unwell. Every year, 2% of its GDP – or £43bn – is lost due to poor health, according to new findings from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). More people are leaving work due to long-term health conditions and more are claiming disability benefits. So long as this persists, calling for growth will be like attempting to compete in a race while being too sick and exhausted to run. The reasons for Britain’s ill health have been widely discussed. Poverty is a major cause. Those on low incomes are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and struggle to afford life’s essentials. If social housing was plentiful, nutritious food subsidised and heating permanently affordable, poverty would not be as harmful to health. But a decade of cuts to public services has left those on low incomes even more exposed. Meanwhile, Whitehall has focused its energies on the NHS, viewing medical treatment as the job of the state and prevention as the responsibility of individuals. Broader health has not been a government priority – a fact signalled by the cynical decision to scrap Public Health England in 2020. , Readers take issue with Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman’s  rhetoric on asylum seekers’ ‘values’ As a volunteer with an organisation helping to support refugees and asylum seekers in Hertfordshire, I have to take issue with Robert Jenrick when he says that their “values and lifestyles” threaten the UK’s social cohesion (‘Values and lifestyles’ of small boat refugees threaten social cohesion, says Jenrick, 25 April). The asylum seekers I have met have been polite, charmingly grateful for our help and eager to get on with their lives. This means working to improve their English – at college, as soon as they are eligible – and, since asylum seekers are not allowed to earn money, keen to volunteer their services to charities and other organisations. The parents are as concerned for their children’s wellbeing as any UK parents, care for them lovingly and encourage them to work hard at school. Meanwhile, they are coping with the trauma of lives disrupted by violence, the turmoil of their journeys to get here and the stresses of living, usually in one room, in a strange country where they are dependent on the kindness of strangers for clothing, shoes and all the necessities of life. In my view, the UK will benefit immeasurably from their presence and the skills and values they bring. Vicky WoodcraftTrustee, Herts Welcomes Refugees , Sudanese crisis | Food prices | Tory foot soldiers | Value of the monarchy | Swearing allegiance I await with interest the UK government’s response to the Sudanese refugee crisis. Given the precedent of providing refuge for those escaping the war in Ukraine, we could reasonably expect that the same would apply to those fleeing violence in Sudan, and that British families would open their doors to them. After all, Britain has been far more closely associated with Sudan than with Ukraine, having had a history of occupation stretching back 150 years.Douglas CurrieEdinburgh • After reading Andy Beckett’s piece on profiteering (Britain once rioted over the price of bread. What would it take for us to confront greedflation today?, 28 April), I went for my weekly shop to a major supermarket (bill double what it used to be). I wanted a small tub of mustard and cress, but it was 60p. I went to my local farm shop, where the same thing cost me 30p.Helen PeirceTeignmouth, Devon ,  Belgian defeats four-time world champion 18-15 in final ‘This has been a crazy week, no practice, just partying’ It may have taken him nine years more than he originally planned, but Luca Brecel’s childhood prophecy has finally been fulfilled. Before he had even stepped through the doors of a Crucible Theatre as a highly-rated 17-year-old, becoming the youngest player in the tournament’s history, the Belgian had already predicted he would become world champion by the age of 19. That, clearly, did not materialise as planned. Brecel hadn’t even won a match here as recently as three weeks ago, going out in the first round on all five of his previous appearances at the Crucible. But now, snooker has its first world champion from mainland Europe and the boy who first picked up a cue as a precocious nine-year-old has delivered on his promise. ,  Wolfsburg win in extra time in WCL semi-final Eidevall says his side is ‘allowed to hurt tonight’ Jonas Eidevall said his Arsenal side is “allowed to hurt tonight and feel empty, but we are also allowed to feel proud of the performance and the occasion”, following a 3-2 semi-final defeat against Wolfsburg deep into extra time to end dreams of a place in the Champions League final. “We made it to the Champions League semi-final and lost by the tiniest of margins,” the Arsenal manager said. “With all the injuries we have, with all the challenges we have, I am incredibly proud.” , An interrogative exhibition at the New-York Historical Society examines the social, cultural and civil rights impact of development and devastation “I want people to understand that the environmental crisis is bound up inextricably in our cultural world and how we relate to each other,” Dr Wendy Nālani E Ikemoto is discussing Nature, Crisis, Consequence, which she curated for the New-York Historical Society. The show juxtaposes classics of 19th-century American naturalism with works by artists from communities largely left out of the historical narratives that these works have been central in enshrining. “It’s not just a problem of science and numbers, it is indivisible from the way we treat each other. How is the environmental crisis also a civil rights crisis?” Running through 16 July, Nature, Crisis, Consequence emerged from a request made of Ikemoto to create a show to feature the NYHS’s 19th-century Hudson River school paintings. Among the Society’s most popular holdings, the Hudson River school works show a romanticized, pastoral version of well-known landscapes upstate from New York City, now thoroughly marked by human development and activity. “They wanted them back on view because they’re so popular,” said Ikemoto, “but I didn’t want to just put these paintings back on the wall.” , Greenpeace Belgium working to release 14 protesters who sailed inflatables into the Fluxys LGN terminal in Zeebrugge Fourteen Greenpeace activists have been held for more than 48 hours after trespassing into and occupying a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal in Zeebrugge, Belgium Greenpeace Belgium said it was working for their release. Valerie Del Re, director of Greenpeace Belgium, said: “It’s not our activists, but gas companies like Fluxys who are the criminals in this story. , Exclusive: up to 10 disused cruise liners, ferries and barges sought to help tackle processing delays The Home Office is planning to use 10 redundant cruise ships, ferries and barges to house asylum seekers in ports around the country, with Liverpool expected to be next in line as ministers struggle to get to grips with the asylum backlog. Officials have been told to look at “all options” to find housing for people caught up in processing delays, including former military camps and prisons, with the total backlog more than 1,500 higher than in December when Rishi Sunak pledged to clear it within a year. , Carl O’Keeffe was taken to hospital after incident at Kong Adventure Centre but died from his injuries The family of a man who died after getting stuck in a cave at an indoor climbing centre in the Lake District say they have been left “broken-hearted”. Carl O’Keeffe, a 49-year-old man from Lancaster, was attending a birthday party with his niece in the Kong Adventure Centre in Keswick, Cumbria on 22 April, Sky News reported. , Move by senior party figures comes after fellow MP said she was worried about how force was handling crimes against woman Labour MPs have spoken to Leicestershire police after Stella Creasy expressed concern about how the force was “dealing with crimes against women” in response to their handling of her harassment case. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, and Liz Kendall, the shadow health secretary, spoke to police after Creasy criticised their handling of a harassment case against a troll who made a baseless complaint about her to social services. , Supporters claim government to rule she broke civil service code in bid to delay role as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Former senior official Sue Gray is facing a “political witch-hunt”, allies believe, with the government set to conclude that she broke the civil service code, in an alleged bid to delay her appointment as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff until after the next general election. Ministers are expected to announce on Tuesday that an internal inquiry into Gray’s departure from Whitehall has concluded that she breached the code by holding talks with Labour about the new role without informing civil service officials. , FSB says business confidence is rising but soaring costs and weakening demand is still slowing growth Small businesses across Britain are warning that the cost of living squeeze is holding back economic growth, after two in five company bosses reported a drop in sales at the start of the year. The Federation of Small Businesses said that although business confidence was rising among bosses before the summer, soaring costs and weakness in consumer demand were still weighing on activity. , Prof Marian Knight says action needed to improve diagnosis of condition in which fertilised egg implants itself outside womb  ‘Worst thing that’s ever happened to me’: the trauma of ectopic pregnancy Women are dying or suffering avoidable harm because of a failure to recognise ectopic pregnancy, one of the country’s leading experts on maternal health has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Prof Marian Knight of the University of Oxford, who leads a national research programme on maternal deaths, called for action to improve diagnosis of the acute, life-threatening condition, in which a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb, normally in the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are never viable and if left untreated can result in the tube rupturing, causing potentially fatal internal bleeding. , Critical shortages of basic goods including water, and bodies piling in streets creating ‘environmental catastrophe’ Sudanese medics have described seeing piles of bodies in the streets of the capital, Khartoum, people drinking polluted water, and doctors working under bombardments as the battle between the country’s two warring generals continues despite a threadbare ceasefire. Intense explosions and shelling were audible in Omdurman, Khartoum’s twin city across the Nile, on Monday and there were reports of further explosions and clashes in the Bahri and Kafouri districts of Khartoum North. In the south of Khartoum, residents reported that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fired anti-aircraft missiles in response to bombardments by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). , The network and Trump had a difficult relationship when he was in office, but the event could goose both of their ratings The announcement that CNN will host a New Hampshire town hall event for Donald Trump was met with widespread criticism on Monday. Angelo Carusone, chief executive of Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog, said: “The transparent attempt to goose their ratings does feel at least a little odious. But all the more reason that they need to get this right.” , Writer tells New York jury George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, encouraged her to take legal action The advice columnist E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump for rape after she was encouraged to take legal action by George Conway, the husband of a top aide to the then president. On her third day on the witness stand, Carroll told the jury hearing her lawsuit for battery and defamation over the alleged sexual assault in a New York department store changing room in 1996 that she did not intend to sue Trump until he called her a liar when she went public with her accusations more than two decades later. , Have you cringed so hard you turned into a fossil?

Today’s dishes are great for impressing vegetarian friends or family, or if you simply want a meat-free dish without feeling as if you’re missing out. If you don’t want to use tofu, swap it for crunchy veg, such as carrot, asparagus or spring cabbage, to create a contrasting texture for the noodles. , Advance raises prospect of new ways to restore speech in those struggling to communicate due to stroke or motor neurone disease An AI-based decoder that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text has been developed, in a breakthrough that allows a person’s thoughts to be read non-invasively for the first time. The decoder could reconstruct speech with uncanny accuracy while people listened to a story – or even silently imagined one – using only fMRI scan data. Previous language decoding systems have required surgical implants, and the latest advance raises the prospect of new ways to restore speech in patients struggling to communicate due to a stroke or motor neurone disease. , Discovery could help plug gaps in understanding of evolution after Cambrian explosion more than 500m years ago Many people discovered new interests closer to home as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. For Dr Joseph Botting and Dr Lucy Muir, it was a 10-metre-wide quarry in a sheep field near to their home in Llandrindod, central Wales, which appeared to be teeming with tiny fossils. Now researchers believe the site could help plug gaps in scientific understanding of how evolution proceeded after the Cambrian explosion – the period when the ancestors of most modern animals are believed to have evolved. It could even prove to be as important as the Burgess Shale in Canada that preserves one of the world’s first complex marine ecosystems, experts say. , Global fleet has more than doubled in two decades, with more private flights made last year than ever before Sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year, placing an increasing burden on the planet, while many of the owners escape aviation taxes, and there are few curbs on the greenhouse gases emitted, according to a report. The global fleet of private jets has more than doubled in the last two decades, and more private flights were made last year than ever before, according to a thinktank report published on Monday. Greenhouse gas emissions from private aviation have increased by nearly a quarter since the pandemic, when flying of all types nearly ceased in many countries for an extended period. , The Guardian’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world , Freight train derailed in border region of Bryansk; children among those injured in attack that appeared to target ammunition depot  At a glance: what we know on day 432 of the invasion Hello, and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Ukraine’s armed forces say they shot down 15 out of 18 missiles launched by Russia in the early hours of Monday morning. , US banking titan to buy ‘all deposits and substantially all assets’ in deal brokered by regulators to contain banking failures JP Morgan is to acquire most of the failed California bank First Republic, in a takeover brokered by regulators as the US races to contain a series of banking failures that has echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis. After weekend talks to prevent a further escalation of the US banking crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. The regulator is providing $50bn (£39.9bn) of financing as part of the deal. , From Lady Chatterley’s Lover to novels about trans children, attempts to suppress works of literature tend to have the opposite effect The 17th century rector of St Alban’s College in Valladolid, Spain, must have rolled his eyes at the size of the book he had to review for the library. The Jesuit seminary, known as the English College because it produced missionaries committed to the reconversion of England to Catholicism, had received a 900-page volume of Shakespeare’s plays. William Sankey prepared his quill and began the long work of censoring ungodly, anti-Catholic and otherwise unsuitable material. “Holy-day fools” – a jibe in the Tempest that seemed to impugn the Christian calendar – struck out. “Heavier soon by the weight of a man”, as Margaret tells Hero on the eve of her wedding in Much Ado About Nothing – filth – blotted into unreadability with heavy ink. A play about a pretend friar and a novice nun: actually, at Measure for Measure Sankey admitted defeat, put down his pen and took a sharp blade to cut out the pages of the entire play. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Dozens of nurses have gathered outside London’s University College Hospital, chanting and singing. Waving placards that demand fair pay and state “enough is enough”, the nurses asked how they could be expected to get by on their current pay, and said they are unable to provide acceptable care to patients due to staffing issues. As staff lined the steps of the hospital, cancer care staff nurse Preya Assi, from Hackney in east London, said: This is a culmination of our pay not reflecting the hours we are working. The last decade has made things considerably worse. Our colleagues are out in force because things have got so bad that we cannot pay our rent or our bills, we are relying on food banks. We have spent the last few years fighting the pandemic. It matters to us and the care we provide matters to us. The fact the government are not looking at our pay has caused us to do this. It’s a profession that I love, I love caring for people, and when I started the job it was not like this. The money was small, but it was sufficient, and we were proud of being a nurse. The definition of nursing is about caring for people and making them comfortable if they are at the end of their lives, but how is that possible when there is one nurse having to look after 10 patients at a time because we’re short-staffed? How am I supposed to live? If I don’t pay my council tax, they take me to court, or if I don’t pay my rent, I lose my home. At 70, I’m still working; what life is that? They are clapping for us but refuse to pay us properly. If they (politicians) were here, I would tell them to their faces. , Officials claim material on Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”.

Based in Shropshire and operating from six vast sheds that churn out 1.3m chickens a year, the business has been hit by a cocktail of pressures. , Unlike the coronation quiche, there wasn’t a broad bean in sight when we asked readers to name their most-loved combinations. From chorizo to asparagus to king trumpet mushrooms, which should you try? Compared to the super-elaborate swiss-roll-and-amaretti trifle introduced to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee last year, King Charles’s coronation quiche seems an underwhelming choice. Its chief innovation – the addition of broad beans – is seasonal but unexciting. And at the end of the day, it’s still just a quiche. Surely, we thought, Guardian readers could do better. An appeal for your own favourite quiche variations was launched. Submissions flooded in. Many refused to enter into the spirit of the exercise – “I hate quiche!” was one, not atypical response. But plenty of variations – from the humble to the exotic to the, frankly, quixotic – were offered up. I was determined to replicate three of them. , A pioneering singing programme from opera houses across Britain is bringing joy to those still struggling with little support I can’t say there’s been a lot of joy having long Covid, but something rather wonderful is happening at the London Coliseum. As part of the English National Opera (ENO) Breathe programme, more than 2,500 of us across England have been meeting in groups on Zoom to do various breathing and vocal exercises, and sing lullabies. This is not a choir, but a social prescribing intervention that uses singing techniques for breathing retraining to aid recovery from Covid-19. Many patients with long Covid have reported that they permanently feel in “flight or fight” mode and struggle to “rest and digest” as the body should. Research shows that this is because of an imbalance in our autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for subconscious processes such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and temperature regulation. Using breathing and other techniques has been shown to help engage a key nerve, the vagus, which can calm an overstimulated system to address this imbalance and put on the brakes. Joanna Herman is a consultant in infectious diseases in London, and teaches at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , With households feeling the squeeze, more retailers are offering dual-use furnishings and gadgets From colourful cushions that look as good in the living room as on the lawn to portable lamps and speakers fit for home working and garden parties, a new breed of versatile household products allows you to economise by furnishing your home and garden in one go. Traditionally, Britons have bought dedicated garden kit but with household finances under pressure and a growing desire to shop more sustainably, retailers have turned to selling “indoor-outdoor” furnishings and gadgets. “We’re seeing customers buying products that have a dual use and look just as good inside the home as they do out,” says the John Lewis head of home accessories, Camilla Rowe. , Many states have restricted how schools can teach race and gender, but only Texas has banned student interaction with elected officials The defining experience of Jordan Zamora-Garcia’s high school career – a hands-on group project in civics class that spurred a new city ordinance in his Austin suburb – would now violate Texas law. Since Texas lawmakers in 2021 passed a ban on lessons teaching that any one group is “inherently racist, sexist or oppressive”, a little-noticed provision of that legislation has triggered a massive fallout for civics education across the state. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Nine out of 10 teachers in England have a negative view of Ofsted, according to a new poll that comes amid calls to overhaul the schools inspectorate following the death of headteacher Ruth Perry. The survey of 1,000 teachers carried out by YouGov last week found that just 7% had a favourable view of Ofsted while 90% said they had an unfavourable view; including 67% who had a “very unfavourable” view of the organisation headed by chief inspector Amanda Spielman. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election? And not least of the reasons for making that the benchmark is that, if you look at what happened before the 1997 general election when Tony Blair won a landslide for Labour, Labour in the local elections leading up to 1997 were regularly recording double-digit leads in what we call the projected national share. , Officials claim material about Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”.

Prof Sir John Curtice said those wanting a clue as to who could win the next general election should be focused on the projected national vote share as the results of Thursday’s poll roll in, rather than on the number of council seats gained. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election?

Once in the brain, “Plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s,” Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes.

Arteta added that his side clearly need to improve if they hope to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, starting with a win over Chelsea on Tuesday. Arsenal have been overtaken by City at the top of the table following a winless run of four games, including draws with Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton. , Newspapers’ power is being eroded and disinformation is rife – but there is a way forward Our understanding of the world is driven by information. It feeds our ability to make informed decisions about our lives, our communities, the way we’re governed. This fundamental freedom, the power to be able to access reliable information, sits at the heart of a thriving democratic society. But increasingly that power is being eroded. Indeed, some never had it to begin with. Press freedom is being threatened, compromised and denied in an increasing number of countries around the world.

Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: “Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe, and those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition.” , Russian missiles have struck warehouses reportedly storing ammunition at a railway depot in the Ukrainian city of Pavlohrad injuring at least 34 people; Ukraine claims to have shot down 15 of 18 missiles fired overnight , A sharp and lucid case for gaining wisdom through adversity rather than books If aught can teach us aught, Affliction’s looks,\n",

Both sides said a formal ceasefire agreement that was due to expire at midnight would be extended for a further 72 hours. The army said it hoped what it called the “rebels” would abide by the deal but it believed they had intended to keep up attacks. The parties have kept fighting through a series of ceasefires over the past week. , Turkish president says Abu Hussein al-Qurashi was killed after long pursuit while northern Syria residents report clashes and large explosion Turkish intelligence forces have killed Islamic State’s leader, Abu Hussein al-Qurashi, in Syria, Turkey’s president has said. “This individual was neutralised as part of an operation by the Turkish national intelligence organisation in Syria yesterday,” Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in an interview with the broadcaster TRT Türk on Sunday. , Paetongtarn, 36, is leading polls to become Thailand’s next prime minister, boosted by the popularity of the Shinawatra name Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the frontrunner in the upcoming Thai election, has given birth to a baby boy two weeks before voters go to the polls. Paetongtarn, the youngest daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, posted a picture of her baby, named Prutthasin Sooksawas, nickname Thasin, on social media on Monday. , Strike affecting half of NHS England trusts as pay dispute continues  Cullen has defended her union’s support for the ongoing strikes, despite previously recommending nurses accept an offer from the government. Speaking about the offer and the decision by RCN members to reject it, Cullen told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: What our nursing staff said was it was neither fair nor reasonable – it puts money in their pockets now but in the long term it doesn’t address recruitment and retention issues. There were some elements of the pay offer that were attractive to our ruling council; for example around safe nurse staffing policy work that’s required in order for us to be able to move to a place where we have safe nurse staffing legislation in place. Patients will still be seen if they unfortunately need to use an emergency department, of course that will always happen. But the delivery of care may be delayed if it is not a life-threatening emergency. If it is an emergency, you will be treated as normal. That’s why we are really emphasising the importance of people not delaying seeking medical help and calling 999 as normal or using 111. But it is inevitable that there will be disruption to normal care even in those services where we have agreed mitigations with the Royal College of Nursing. Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe. And those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition. They don’t turn their back on patients, they will continue to do what they need to do. , Fair Judgement raises funds for case in response to death of Berkshire primary headteacher Ruth Perry A group of senior school leaders is calling on teachers to donate £1 each to launch a legal challenge against Ofsted, pledging to hold the inspectorate to account for “ending careers” and causing a mental health crisis. The vice-president of the Conservative education society, John Bald, a former Ofsted inspector, is fronting a crowdfunding page for the group, which is called Fair Judgement. The leaders fear the inspectorate may seek to punish their schools if they go public.

Prigozhin, whose group is spearheading Russia’s attack on the embattled city of Bakhmut, predicted a Ukrainian counterattack in mid-May and said Wagner had “only 10-15% of the shells that we need.” Pope Francis has said that the Vatican is involved in a peace mission to try to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I am willing to do everything that has to be done. There is a mission in course now but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it,” Pope Francis told reporters during a flight home after a three-day visit to Hungary. The Russian army replaced its highest ranking general in charge of logistics, after days of rumours about the sacking of Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said Alexei Kuzmenkov – a former official from the National Guard – had replaced Mizintsev as “deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation, responsible for the logistical support of the Armed Forces.” The statement did not say why Mizintsev was replaced after just seven months in the job. Ukraine said its troops were holding on to parts of the eastern city of Bakhmut. “The enemy is unable to take control over the city, despite throwing all its forces into the battle and having some success,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said its forces had taken four blocks in western Bakhmut on Sunday, according to Reuters, which could not independently confirm the claim. Four people have been killed from an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka, the governor of Russia’s western Bryansk region said on Sunday. “Two more civilians have been found and removed from the rubble. Unfortunately, both of them died,” local governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Russian commanders have likely started “punishing breaches in discipline by detaining the offending troops in ‘Zindans’ which are improvised cells consisting of holes in the ground covered with a metal grille,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. The army is thought to have been using “increasingly draconian” measures to enforce discipline since autumn 2022, the MoD said, and “especially since Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov assumed command of the operation in January 2023.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a “long and meaningful” telephone conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The French presidency said Macron had reaffirmed France’s support for Ukraine to Zelenskiy, and that Macron had given an update on European coordination to give Ukraine military help. Funerals were held for some of the 23 people who were killed on Friday when two Russian missiles hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city Uman. Six children were among the dead. With Reuters and AFP , Thirty years after the racist murder of his friend, Brooks wants to run the city whose police failed him and so many others – as a Conservative. What makes him think he can do better than Sadiq Khan? Saturday 22 April was the 30th anniversary of the day Stephen Lawrence was murdered by racist youths while waiting for a bus in south-east London. Lawrence’s family along with public figures including Keir Starmer and Sadiq Khan attended a memorial service in central London, but not his friend Duwayne Brooks, who was with him when he was attacked. “I was refereeing,” he says matter-of-factly. Like he does every weekend, for his south London football league. Not that Brooks believes the occasion shouldn’t be remembered. “In my opinion it’s got to be marked every year,” he says. “It’s not just the Lawrence family that suffered because of what happened to their son – there are families across Britain who have suffered similar in terms of their children being taken so young.” , Diane and David Rowsell were looking forward to spending more time with the grandchildren. Then they discovered how many of their neighbours in York were going hungry “We fell into it,” says Diane Rowsell, 63, of the community food support project that she and husband David, 64, started in 2020. “It wasn’t like we sat at home thinking: ‘What can we do with our lives now?’” Pre-retirement they were busy: David’s job as a headteacher allowed them to live in the Czech Republic and the US, where Diane, a physiotherapist by training, also worked teaching music; they travelled extensively and adventurously in their free time. Back home in York, they were looking forward to more travel, plus time on their allotment and with their grandchildren. “Just that era of life – busy doing not much!” says Diane. But it doesn’t sound that quiet when she explains that the couple bought a camper van, David was working as a leadership coach, she was taking art classes, and both were volunteering – Diane gardening and David chairing the local school board of governors.

But alongside what you might expect (a commemorative plate or King Charles mug) are some rather unusual offerings, as some businesses and their PR teams seem to be doing anything possible to mark the day. We’ve done a roundup of the most unexpected coronation merchandise out there, as well as the simply awkward and bizarre. , He was a trail-blazing genius who electrified US ballet. But he was also a dictatorial grudge-bearer who married four of his dancers. How should we remember the Russian-American choreographer? ‘I don’t have a past. I have a continuous present,” said the great Russian-American choreographer George Balanchine, a great believer in forward motion. When Balanchine’s health began to fail, in his mid-70s, he resisted making a will, not thinking that the hundreds of ballets he had created would live on without him. When the IRS posthumously valued his repertory, it decided that the maximum shelf life of even his greatest ballets was just 15 years. Yet today, almost exactly 40 years after Balanchine’s death, his works are as popular as ever. New York City Ballet (NYCB), the company he founded, has just announced its 75th anniversary season, with dozens of performances of his works. Masterful ballets such as Serenade, Symphony in C and Agon are still regularly danced around the world. This summer, the Australian Ballet comes to the UK to perform his Jewels. When Carlos Acosta marks his 50th birthday on stage in July, it is Balanchine’s Apollo that he will dance. , Air pollution and the climate crisis are making pollen even more of a menace. Here’s how to stop your eyes itching and nose streaming If you’ve found yourself reaching for the tissues more than usual recently, you’re not alone. The sun has shown its face a bit, and thanks to the arrival of a tree pollen bomb, which occurs when groups of trees release millions of grains of pollen at the same time, many of us are trading the joys of spring for itchy eyes and streaming noses. According to Margaret Kelman, acting head of clinical services at Allergy UK, the number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years, with the condition now affecting one in four adults in the UK. “Climate change, including increased air pollution, has contributed to more intense pollen seasons,” she says. “Warmer weather speeds up the growing process, causing pollen seasons to start earlier and last longer.” , It’s gripping, nuanced, almost unbearably tense – and it’s about to come to an end. The BBC show’s take on policing post-Troubles Belfast is one of the finest watches of the year When Blue Lights first appeared, it was hard to get too excited about yet another cop show. We are only at the end of April and already the year has been stuffed with them, from the great (Happy Valley) to the functionally decent (Unforgotten) to the fine (Better), you can’t move for a moody detective or a seemingly uncrackable case. One theory about their enduring appeal is that police procedurals are the most psychologically satisfying form of storytelling, because they fulfil what the human brain finds pleasurable about drama – a puzzle to solve, red herrings and false starts, and the idea that somebody knows what’s going on, even if we don’t yet. Written and co-created by Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson (who wrote The Salisbury Poisonings), Blue Lights sets itself apart from the pack. The series – whose final episode airs on BBC One tonight – has a journalistic eye for detail and nuance. It sidesteps the case-of-the-week template, preferring to take an overview of the incredibly complex world of policing in Belfast. This is rich material. First broadcast just before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it paints a detailed picture of the city as it is today, with the Troubles never far from that picture, whether in the highly sensitive issue of policing by consent (and consent is not a given), or in the histories of the men (and women) involved in organised crime. , Scottish-born chef started career in kitchens at the age of 12 before moving to Australia and opening prize-winning restaurants that faltered as mainstream success grew  • Jock Zonfrillo, MasterChef Australia judge and chef, dies aged 46 As a culinary figure, Jock Zonfrillo reached the highest peaks in Australia, his adopted homeland. He won national and international awards, and went on to become a television star with a coveted judging spot on MasterChef. However the life of the chef and television personality, who died on 30 April at age 46, had great lows, both private and public. Zonfrillo, whose legal name is Barry, was raised in Ayr, Scotland. His father, Ivan, was a barber, and his paternal grandparents had migrated to Scotland from Italy, while his mother Sarah’s family were farmers in Scotland. , The site’s success has led to it being accused of swamping tourist hotspots with short-term lets and forcing out locals With its burgeoning, vibrant arts scene, Margate was the perfect base for Dan Thompson, a writer and social activist. But when his landlord came to sell his flat, he was left with nowhere to move to, due to a shortage of properties in the area. One reason, he believes, is that many of the homes are let as short-term rentals on Airbnb. Almost 640 entire homes are let out in the coastal town, according to rental analytics company AirDNA. , We tried and tried, but failed and failed. Yet the fertility industry kept offering us hope, so long as we offered them money Is it possible to become addicted to fertility treatment? When does spending tens of thousands of pounds on IVF with no guarantee that it will actually work become a gambling problem? These are the questions I am searching for answers to as I meet virtually with a doctor from a top London fertility clinic. “Women are a mystery,” he jokes. I smile politely into the tiny camera on my laptop. I had been considering treatment with his clinic and we have spent the last hour running through my history of infertility, or rather, in my case, incomplete fertility. My husband and I have been trying for nine years to have a baby. I’m quite good at getting pregnant, especially when we first started trying, but I can’t seem to stay pregnant. I don’t know why. And as it turns out, neither do the experts. I have spent years seeking their help, and because IVF wasn’t available on the NHS in my area, I have paid thousands of pounds along the way in my relentless pursuit of pregnancy. , The Guardian was right to remove and delete the cartoon published on Saturday, but with all that is known about anti-Jewish symbols and images, this should not be happening Other than his closest friends, it is unlikely that anybody would complain if a Guardian cartoonist drew Boris Johnson as a gorilla. All’s fair in political satire, cartoonists are expected to be scurrilous, and the former prime minister is fair game. But if that same cartoonist drew a black politician in simian form, it would be obviously racist. This is the principle to hold in mind when decoding Martin Rowson’s cartoon of outgoing BBC chair Richard Sharp, who is Jewish, in Saturday’s Guardian. Centuries of anti-Jewish caricaturists (and to be clear, I do not accuse Rowson or the Guardian of falling into this category) have generated an extensive library of visual tropes to convey their hatred of, and disgust for, Jews. This is partly because antisemites face a challenge: how do you incite hatred against a group of people who are not always readily identifiable? Not every Jew wears religious clothing or “looks Jewish” to every beholder. Dr Dave Rich is author of Everyday Hate: How antisemitism is built into our world and how you can change it , There is unease about what happens next. We’re not perfect, but politicians will do anything but address their own shortcomings So, exactly who is making the UK apparently ungovernable? Is it bullying, psychotic ministers intent on stoking the culture wars until Gary Lineker, the BBC, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and every other woke-sucking, electorate-hating public institution is consumed by its righteous flames? Or is it, more specifically, us “over-unionised”, “activist” civil servants – who, despite being a “very small minority” of milquetoast snowflakes, are still somehow capable of orchestrating the ruthless defenestration of Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay and any other poor minister who dares to actually get something – anything – done? , The Harold and Maude actor shows us that spur of the moment acts of generosity can be truly life affirming On the first day directing my first film came my first communication error. I’d asked the costume department to take a man’s shirt (which the lead character had stolen after a one night stand), and fashion it into something she fixes around her cat to stop it picking at its surgical stitches. Expecting it to look like a striped cotton bandage, I was presented with a cat wearing an immaculately tailored miniature button-down. In the end I took it off the cat, but I wish I’d made that work because, when I’ve occasionally daydreamed about the etymology of phrases, I’ve always felt drawn to “the shirt off my back”. At the end of the shoot, my lead, Jemima Kirke, slipped off a diamond and ruby fox ring and handed it to me – the ring off her own finger! I was touched by the gesture and by the echo from a woman I’d cast as “me”: I’d done this same thing myself to friends when I felt they needed moral support, unhooking a bracelet or brooch and pressing it into their palm. It’s never the value of the jewellery that matters as much as the instant decision. Maybe it’s a sense of memory conversation with the ancestors who sewed valuables into their clothes as they fled expulsions, pogroms and ghettoes; letting the past know I feel safe enough in my own life to give my precious things away. I’d say I’ve lost three pieces of jewellery this way, but they’re the opposite of lost. , I have explained what has happened to me, on my own terms, and people have responded in kind I’ve had a double mastectomy. I don’t find it straightforward to spell or to pronounce, but it’s the term I find easiest to use when I tell people what has happened to me. I just can’t put it in plain English, and say exactly what the surgeons did. This may change, but it seems too painful to me, and I worry about the people listening. Generally, since I was diagnosed with breast cancer last summer I have tried to avoid couching things in terms that may be unclear. Years of writing articles on complicated financial products and schemes in my roles on the Guardian’s Money and Investigations desks have conditioned me to avoid jargon. I like to get to the point and use language that is accessible, rather than words that exclude people, and in the main I have taken this approach to my illness. Hilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editor , The president is trying to appeal to climate-conscious young voters and appease the fossil fuel industry. It won’t work Just before announcing that he would again run for president, Joe Biden signed off on what on the surface looks like a great move to help address the climate crisis: an executive order that creates an office of environmental justice in the White House. “Environmental justice,” the president said from the Rose Garden, “will be the mission of the entire government, woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments.” That is a beautiful sentiment. And sentiment, when coupled with substantive policy positions, can lead the country forward. The idea of a White House office that can help mobilize an all-of-government response to the climate crisis could be a force multiplier in the fight to save the planet. But to be effective it needs real presidential leadership that involves the creation of a bold and realistic plan to phase out fossil fuels along a strict timeline. Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer, a Guardian US columnist, and the creator of the Substack newsletter Donziger on Justice , Unsuccessful US college applicants have started having cathartic parties to ‘celebrate’. I think they might be on to something High school students in the US are tackling the brutal process of college applications with rejection parties, the New York Times reported last week. At one school, students bring along a printout of their college rejections, ceremonially feed them into a shredder, then get an ice-cream; there is a prize for the most rejected. It sounds wonderful: a cathartic, collective “screw you” to a broken system, using fun to salve the pain. I wonder if owning rejection is easier in the US, where there is at least a partial sense that failure is OK; it’s considered a learning opportunity and a key part of the origin story. The Silicon Valley motto “fail fast, fail often” took hold because failure was seen as indicative of audacity and a willingness to try. Rejection is a particularly stinging subset of failure, but the principle remains: you took the shot; it didn’t pay off; you try again. , Harry Kane faces big decision, Palace are throwback entertainers and Gary O’Neil shows humility amid success Jack Grealish has stopped falling over. But it’s not just that. Grealish was fouled just twice against Fulham, neither of these the contact-seeking lunges that had for a while become a part of his game. Grealish isn’t necessarily cheating or diving when he does this. The take-the-foul routine is also a way of having your legs battered into a pulp over several years. Grealish carries the ball too well not to be tripped a lot. Contact will happen. Why not manage how that collision works, take the lightest of touches, fall well? But Grealish has started to stay up as well, to use his strength instead to terrorise and bully defenders. He was very good against Fulham, helping to make the opening goal, and just about surviving an ongoing battle with Kenny Tete, who was defending aggressively. Another thing here: the Fulham crowd barracked Grealish and he wagged his finger back at them. But the feeling was less outrage, more pantomime jeers, a kind of semi-buried respect. The other story of Grealish’s season is that he is now surely the most marketable English player in the league; and, grudgingly perhaps for some, one of the most likeable. Barney Ronay Match report: Fulham 1-2 Manchester City Match report: Liverpool 4-3 Tottenham Match report: Manchester United 1-0 Aston Villa , BBC broadcaster is synonymous with the event after more than 20 years as TV’s face of the world snooker championship This year’s World Snooker Championship has produced what some fans of the sport would consider a long overdue wind of change on the baize. Sure, Mark Selby can cement his place in history on bank holiday Monday if he wins the title for a fifth time, but the sight of two players under the age of 30 in Luca Brecel and Si Jiahui playing out a world semi-final felt refreshing if nothing else, given how the sport has been dominated by the same clutch of players for so long. Sports thrive on progression and evolution when it comes to the stars of the show – but away from the action, consistency is a valuable commodity. And for all the change snooker is trying to undergo, there is one bastion of consistency who perhaps never quite gets the credit they truly deserve. In an ever-changing world, nothing screams comforting reassurance like Hazel Irvine presenting the snooker on the BBC. She will utter the first words to the new champion of the world on Monday evening and these days anyone other than Irvine on hand for the biggest moments that matter in snooker feels wrong. , Refreshing response to a question from the media was unlike much of the discourse surrounding elite professional sport Almost certainly fed up while facing the press in the media centre of Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum last Wednesday night, Giannis Antetokounmpo made no attempt to disguise his utter contempt for the query he had just been asked to field. The Bucks basketball legend had fronted up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate after his team’s elimination by the lowly ranked Miami Heat after a five-game series, arguably one of the most seismic upsets in NBA playoff history. Antetokounmpo’s gaze was caught by Eric Nehm, the man from the Athletic on the Bucks beat, who kept his question fairly short and to the point. He had already asked it of Antetokounmpo’s coach and now wished to hear the player’s considered opinion. “Do you view this season as a failure?” A protracted sigh from the top table was followed by an audible groan of “Oh my God”, as Antetokounmpo wearily rubbed his hands up his face and through his hair, in the manner of a man who can’t quite believe the absolute inanity of the question he’s just been asked. Countering with several of his own, rhetorical questions regarding the successes or failures his inquisitor might have enjoyed or endured in his professional life over the past 12 months, he proceeded to expound on his own idea of what constitutes failure, or if there’s even any such thing. “Michael Jordan played 15 years,” he said. “Won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That’s what you’re telling me? I’m asking you a question, yes or no?” , Time will tell who got the best haul of players in Kansas City this year but the already formidable Philly look like they aced the draft once again Philadelphia Eagles. In the past two seasons, the Eagles have given masterclasses in how to execute a perfect draft. The reigning NFC champions have found gold in the south by selecting top-tier players from college football’s best defense. In last year’s draft, the Eagles selected two dominant defensive players, Jordan Davis and Nakobe Dean, both of whom helped the Georgia Bulldogs capture the 2022 national championship. , Project hopes Beatles classic will ‘unite the world’ and show victims of the conflict that they’ll never walk alone An ambitious campaign to create the world’s biggest sing-along as an expression of solidarity with Ukraine during the Eurovision song contest is gaining momentum. The #HelpUkraineSong project is aiming to “unite the world through music” by getting as many people as possible to sing the Beatles’ With a Little Help from My Friends at noon on Saturday 13 May. , Children’s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, urges first minister to put UN protections for under-18s into law Scotland’s outgoing children’s commissioner has warned Humza Yousaf that it will be his “personal failure” if he fails to make good on Nicola Sturgeon’s promise to put international children’s rights standards at the heart of Scottish law. In one of his final interviews before he steps down from the role after six years, Bruce Adamson accused Scottish ministers of “heartbreaking” delays, lack of transparency and “constant broken promises”, after the supreme court ruled that initial attempts at incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law went beyond Holyrood’s powers. , Study of 200,000 Chinese hospital admissions finds acute exposure to air pollution raises risk of heart arrhythmias Spikes in air pollution increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, a large study has found. The research, based on nearly 200,000 hospital admissions in China, found a significant increase in risk of arrhythmias in the first few hours after an increase in air pollution levels. Heart arrhythmias can increase the risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death. , Investors claim sportswear giant failed to minimise their exposure to risk after the rapper and designer’s antisemitic comments led to a sharp decline in the share price Adidas shareholders have filed a class action lawsuit against the sportswear brand, claiming it knew about Kanye West’s problematic behaviour years before it ended their partnership over his antisemitic comments. The shareholders also allege that Adidas failed to mitigate their financial losses or take precautionary measures to minimise their exposure, after the designer and rapper’s erratic behaviour and offensive comments saw him and his Yeezy brand dropped by Adidas, which resulted in a sharp decline in the company’s stock. , Participants who turned in guns were given up to $500 for each firearm at nine program locations throughout the state Thousands of guns were surrendered across New York on Saturday in exchange for gift cards as part of the state’s gun buyback program. According to the New York attorney general, Letitia James, whose office organized the event, more than 3,000 guns including various assault-style rifles and “ghost guns” were given up in what she hailed as a “landmark event”. , Despite the pain of the condition, diagnoses take seven years on average globally.

Yet it took nearly 20 doctors more than 10 years for her to get a diagnosis. “I got an ultrasound every month where they told me it was all clear and I should ‘do yoga’ or ‘get pregnant’,” says Singh. “I have a bone to pick with all of those doctors.” Her experience is not unusual. Globally, it takes seven years on average to get a diagnosis, even though endometriosis is as common as diabetes, affecting one in 10 women. , Wall Street stalwart to buy ‘all deposits and substantially all assets’ of collapsed bank in deal brokered by federal regulators JP Morgan is to acquire most of the collapsing California bank First Republic, in a takeover brokered by regulators as the US races to contain a rash of bank failures with echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis. After weekend talks brokered by regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. , Santiago Peña of the Colorado party is elected, defeating Efraín Alegre who wanted to switch diplomatic recognition to China Paraguay’s ruling party candidate, Santiago Peña, 44, has scored a big win in the presidential election, tightening the conservative Colorado party’s political grip and defusing fears that diplomatic ties with Taiwan might have been cut. Peña, who has pledged to maintain Paraguay’s longstanding Taiwan relations, had 42.7% of the vote with more than 99% of ballots counted – a more than 15-point lead over centre-left rival Efraín Alegre, who has argued for switching allegiance to China. , Ahead of King Charles III’s coronation, prime minister voices support for separating from monarchy but says it is not a priority New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has said he supports the country becoming a republic but has no immediate plans to act on separation from the monarchy. Hipkins was holding a press conference hours before departing to attend King Charles III’s coronation, when he was asked about the prospect of New Zealand’s independence from the crown. , Reporters say even seemingly innocuous stories are putting them at risk of assault, intimidation and police action under the Digital Security Act Four weeks ago, a reporter in Bangladesh was hauled from his office, badly beaten - and then thrown from the roof of his building, leaving him with fractures in his back, three broken ribs and a machete wound on his head. The journalist, Ayub Meahzi, believes he was targeted for reporting on alleged local government ties to a criminal group. The attack in Chattogram, south-east Bangladesh, has compounded fears of a deterioration in press freedom in the country, which languishes near the bottom of a global press freedom index due to be updated later this week by the group Reporters Sans Frontières. , Over the years, female artists like Georgia O’Keeffe and Hilma af Klint have received scathing reviews. When will women stop being seen as easy targets? In 1993, the reviews for Georgia O’Keeffe’s exhibition at London’s Hayward gallery came in. In the Independent, Andrew Graham-Dixon likened the American artist to a “commercial illustrator” who had “limited talents … but the ambition to be remembered as a Rembrandt”. The Evening Standard’s Brian Sewell said her works were “irredeemably amateur”. William Feaver of the Observer proclaimed that her paintings “made good monthly images on calendars”, while Hilton Kramer’s review in the Sunday Telegraph called her “grossly overrated”, adding that “her great personal beauty played a major role in the myth that now attaches to her name”. Many of these comments are quoted in an article by Beatrix Campbell, published in the Independent in 1993, with the headline: A Woman’s Art That Men Refuse to See. Campbell argued for a more intellectual reading of O’Keeffe – complaining that “national newspaper art critics do not think it necessary to explain or empathise with … or to locate her in the history of American modernism”. This made me think about how so much art criticism is written from a male point of view, and the exceedingly wide gender imbalance that still exists within it. , Our roundup of drama to watch at home includes Panti Bliss’s drag journey, Athol Fugard’s ballroom dreamers and Alain Platel’s nightmarish dance-theatre How very! The sour bubblegum musical inspired by the cult 80s teen movie was filmed during its residency at London’s Other Palace, where they offer karaoke nights and “freeze your brain” cocktails. Make your own slushie and sing along on the sofa as Veronica and JD do some damage. On Icon Film Channel. , The actor’s tale about the creation of a fantasy film captures the humdrum of Hollywood but lacks his on-screen ability to breathe life into characters There is probably a good reason why it is hard to compile a list of decent novels about the making of films (I can think of one, Terry Southern’s Blue Movie): nothing much happens. Or as Tom Hanks observes in this ambitious addition to the genre: “making movies is complicated, maddening, highly technical at times”. Reading it is to be reminded that Hanks, one of the greatest of all movie stars, must have had a good deal of time on his hands during lockdown. Part of its motivation appears to be to give a proper flavour of that truism of movie making: that so much of it is waiting around; three days sitting in a trailer for a minute or two of drama that might end up in a digital suite trash can. This novel, if nothing else, gives you a sense of that experience in real time. Hanks, a famous collector of typewriters, has put them to use once before, in a short story collection that came out in 2017. On that occasion his publisher ventured that “the two-time Oscar winner is as talented a writer as he is an actor”. His screen agent might have had something to say. He writes well enough – there are many artfully constructed scenes here – and what he doesn’t know about the world of this book you’d imagine is not worth knowing; but that quality that he possesses in so much range and depth on screen – the ability to make you care deeply about lives not your own – is quite often elusive on the page. , ...]   \n",

party of home ownership,’ says Starmer Keir Starmer today pledges to lead a radical, reforming Labour government that is bolder than Tony Blair’s on public service reform, as he announces plans to accelerate housing building and get more young people on to the property ladder. In an interview with the Observer before Thursday’s local elections, the Labour leader insists he will more than match Blair for radical ideas on overhauling public services including the NHS. “This will be a bold and reforming Labour government bringing about real change that I hope will be felt through the generations,” Starmer said. , Investigation reveals that at least 440 people appear to have been abandoned in the weeks before the worst Channel disaster in 30 years • Read more: ‘Horror beyond words’: how Channel distress calls were ‘ignored’ Hundreds of vulnerable migrants were abandoned to their fates after the UK coastguard “effectively ignored” reports of small boats in distress during the days leading up to the worst Channel disaster in 30 years when at least 27 people died, an Observer investigation suggests. Around 440 people appear to have been left adrift after the coastguard sent no rescue vessels to 19 reported boats carrying migrants in UK waters, according to an analysis of internal records and marine data seen by the Observer and Liberty Investigates. Experts said the failure to act appears to breach international law. , Nearly 1,900 have been evacuated, says UK government, but final flight has yet to leave Khartoum Britons are feared to have been stranded in Sudan following reports that the country’s armed forces had prevented a number of people from reaching the last rescue flights out of the war-torn country on Saturday. On Saturday night, it was announced that 1,888 people on 21 flights have been evacuated from Sudan – the vast majority of them British nationals and their dependents – but the last flight was yet to leave despite being scheduled to depart at 6pm. , Opinium poll shows slump in personal ratings of Rishi Sunak, with 26% approving of his performance and 44% disapproving Labour’s lead over the Conservatives stands at a commanding 18 points, according to the last Opinium poll for the Observer before a huge set of local elections. With more than 8,000 council seats across 230 authorities in England up for election on Thursday, the Tories had been hoping that polls would tighten as they attempt to avoid heavy losses in both the red wall of old Labour seats and the blue all – south-eastern seats where, traditionally, they have been strong. , MP questions police response that troll who tried to have her children removed was ‘entitled’ to call her an ‘extremist’ The Labour MP Stella Creasy believes police have given online trolls “the green light to target the children of politicians” after she was subject to a baseless complaint to social services. Creasy was investigated by her local council after it received a report from a troll who was trying to have her children taken away from her. , Advice comes despite charity’s warning that social media figure is fuelling shocking growth of misogyny in schools Teachers are being advised by the government not to discuss social media influencer Andrew Tate, the “king of toxic masculinity”, with pupils – despite schools reporting a rising tide of misogyny and sexual harassment from boys as young as nine. One small charity, Diversify, based in Rotherham, which runs school workshops about inclusion, receives about 25 calls a week from primary and secondary schools across England who want help dealing with sexual harassment and “shocking misogynistic incidents”. Many cite the influence of Tate, who is under house arrest in Romania for suspected human trafficking and organised crime. Tate’s TikTok videos tell boys that a woman belongs to her boyfriend; girls who don’t stay at home are “hoes”; and rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks. , Warm weather expected to continue over bank holiday weekend, and sunny day expected for King’s coronation England, Wales and Northern Ireland celebrated the hottest day of the year so far on Saturday, and temperatures were expected to rise further over the bank holiday weekend. The Met Office recorded a high of 20.2C in Pershore, Worcestershire. In Northern Ireland, temperatures peaked at 20C at Castle Derg, while in Wales, 19.2C was recorded in Llysdinam. , British subjects asked to form a ‘chorus of a million voices’ and make oath of loyalty while watching service Members of the public watching the coronation on television, online and in parks and pubs will be invited to swear aloud their allegiance to the monarch in a “chorus of millions of voices” to be known as the Homage of the People. People around the UK and abroad will be invited to say the words “I swear that I will pay true allegiance to your majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God”, in a declaration that replaces the traditional homage of peers. , Campaigners commemorate mammal that drew large crowds in Norwegian capital last summer before being put down A bronze sculpture has been unveiled in Norway of the walrus nicknamed Freya, who gained global attention last summer after basking in the Oslo fjord until officials euthanised her. The lifesize sculpture depicts Freya lying on her side on the rocky shore of Oslo’s Kongen marina, not far from where the real 600kg mammal last summer drew large crowds as she chased ducks and swans, and rested on boats that struggled to support her bulk. , Fire at facility in port of Sevastopol caused no casualties and will not hinder supplies, authorities say  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates At a glance: what we know on day 430 of the invasion A fire at a fuel storage facility in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, caused by an apparent drone strike, has been extinguished, the Moscow-installed governor has said. . Video footage posted on social media earlier on Saturday showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area.

Sydney dock worker Jack Franklyn is partly obscured by bush, leaning forward, his rifle poised and ready. New Zealander Bert Bryan, bare-chested and wearing a beret, crouches at the edge of a trench while shooting at the enemy. They’re in Spain, the battle of Ebro in 1938, and the fact they are fighting together in one of the Spanish civil war’s most seminal and bloody battles lends a gritty new dimension to the revered legend of Anzac. The photograph was recently discovered among personal mementoes in the western Sydney home of 80-year-old Vanessa McNeill. Her father, Wollongong steel worker Jim McNeill fought the fascists alongside Bryan and Franklyn at Ebro, which began 85 years ago this July. McNeill was shot by a machine gun at Ebro, his second wounding in Spain. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads , The silver fox sex icon says he’d rather eat a tangerine than make love. It’s time to reconsider what’s normal in long-term relationships Have we stumbled into an era of sexual ennui? Particularly as we age and couple up, do we increasingly drag our weary, uninspired carcasses to bed, and … nothing? Nada. That’s that. Robbie Williams has been talking about his sex life with Ayda Field, his wife of 13 years. “Everyone knows there is no sex after marriage,” he said, musing that stopping taking testosterone was probably partly responsible for his drop in libido. Williams continued: “Sometimes now, Ayda will turn to me on the sofa and say, ‘We should do sex’, and I’m sitting there eating a tangerine and just sort of shrug.” , Australia forward on adapting to playing overseas and preparing to pack the waterproofs for this year’s Women’s World Cup at home Mary Fowler is becoming accustomed to astonished looks from her Manchester City teammates when she advises those heading to this summer’s World Cup to pack woollens and waterproofs. “A lot of the girls are going to Australia and New Zealand with their countries,” says the Matildas striker. “But most of them expect it to be quite warm, so I’m excited to see how they’re going to react when they realise it’s freezing cold. “Sydney will be chilly but I feel really bad for the girls in New Zealand, the southern hemisphere winter’s going to be freezing there! But, hey, if they’ve lived in England, they’ll survive.” , The founders of Melbourne’s Steam Room program believe scientists can make their work more accessible through humour.

Out in paperback, it was longlisted for last year’s Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction while being praised by Geoff Dyer for its “novelistic virtues of vivid scene-making, fully realised characterisation and psychological subtlety”. Hill and I sat in a park near his home in east London. I might have read this as a novel had it not been subtitled “a memoir”.The subtitle wasn’t my choice: I was open to it being published as fiction if my publisher had wanted that. I approached it like a novel, thinking about point of view and how I’d produce moments of irony and humour, which maybe liberated me to write with an emotional distance that paradoxically allowed me to be more honest. Nothing is fabricated. I did go to psychiatric units. I was a heroin addict for all that time. I used my imagination to make vivid the bits of dialogue or details about what we were wearing, although it’s surprising how detailed your recollections are once you dig in; what my father told my mother on that car ride to Guernsey – “If you died tonight, I’d dance on your grave” – was scored into my childhood memory.

Almost 60,000 fans attended the Red Roses’ 38-33 victory over France and the popularity of the women’s game is expected to increase ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England. “I want to sell out Twickenham,” said England’s victorious captain, Marlie Packer. “I believe we can do it and I believe we can do it before 2025 for the World Cup final. , A brilliant team are demolishing even closest rivals and can make history. But glory lies in drama as well as excellence Manchester City are brilliant. They can win games with and without the ball. They can stifle teams with possession or eviscerate them on the counter. They can produce moments of breathtaking combination play but also have in Erling Haaland a centre-forward with a set of attributes, physical and technical, that has been seen only perhaps half a dozen times before. They are magnificent and seemingly on course for a treble. They are also a symptom of the financial structures that are destroying the game football was once understood to be. The naive and the wilfully blind will say there have been dominant teams before, but not like this there haven’t. Assuming City do go on to win the Premier League, this will be the third time in English history a club have won five titles in six seasons: Liverpool did it between 1979 and 1984 and Manchester United between 1996 and 2001. ,  Verstappen warns Russell after close call at turn three Pérez overtakes Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc for victory in Baku In a season where Max Verstappen and Red Bull already threaten to run away with it, at the Azerbaijan sprint race the Dutchman was handed a salutary reminder that he should not expect an easy ride. Mercedes’ George Russell was the driver to give no quarter, which infuriated Verstappen and caused as feisty an exchange off track as they had with one another on the streets of Baku. It ended with Verstappen warning he would be gunning for Russell in future. The pair’s battle and its ill-tempered fallout was by far the highlight of another somewhat processional sprint, won by Verstappen’s teammate, Sergio Pérez from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, with Verstappen taking third. ,  Leinster 41-22 Toulouse Irish side score four tries while opposition down to 14 men The procession continues. No matter that the visit was of mighty Toulouse, the only club with a richer pedigree in this competition, Leinster march into the final of the Champions Cup as if it were the most natural, obvious cadence to an already stellar season. Whether it is in the green shirts of Ireland or the blue of their province, these players have yet to be beaten this season. Toulouse are not quite so closely a mirror of their national team, but they include France’s best. This might represent a sobering afternoon for more than just France’s most successful club side in this, the year of their home World Cup. , France prop credits Irish coach with transforming the Champions Cup holders but is wary of Exeter before Sunday’s semi-final Uini Atonio is right on time for our Zoom appointment. “I think we’re having lunch soon,” he says with a grin. “I don’t want to be late for that.” The prop’s desire to fuel up is understandable because there is hard work to do. La Rochelle, the Champions Cup holders, stand two victories away from retaining the trophy they won in a dramatic showdown against Leinster last season. Ronan O’Gara’s side meet Exeter on Sunday in the second semi-final, in Bordeaux, for the right to play Leinster in next month’s final in Dublin. La Rochelle have already knocked Saracens and Gloucester out of Europe and are engaged in a tight battle against Toulouse for the French Top 14 title, so it may seem natural to regard them as favourites, particularly in view of Exeter’s mixed domestic form. But that is not how Atonio sees it. , Jürgen Klopp’s £35m signing is starting to score goals and have an influence before Roberto Firmino departs in the summer Cody Gakpo’s first six games as a Liverpool player yielded one victory. He joined a club low on confidence and bereft of form, making the transition from life in the Eredivisie to the Premier League a tougher one than he and the club would have desired. After a six-week trip to the World Cup quarter-finals, Gakpo’s return to domestic football was at a new club in a new country, with the small matter of £35m changing hands. If it has been a confusing season for some due to the World Cup in Qatar breaking up the calendar, Gakpo has had more than most to adapt to but is looking settled as Liverpool prepare to face Tottenham on Sunday. , Has Manchester City’s 4-1 win wrapped up the Premier League? Perhaps not if Mikel Arteta and his players can hang in there Arsenal’s defensive problems in the absence of William Saliba are little secret. They have conceded 2.17 goals a game without the centre-back; with him, that figure reads 0.93. Arguably they have missed Takehiro Tomiyasu in equal measure: he has been injured since mid-March, like Saliba, and could have slotted in at centre-back, taken on bespoke defensive tasks at left-back or, perhaps most attractively, been fielded at right-back to allow Ben White a move inside. , My mother’s contribution to perhaps the most overlooked British folk art of the past 90 years: the canvas-work church kneelerIt’s probably too soon to suggest, as the Rev Richard Coles recently did, that Elizabeth Bingham’s Kneelers is the best non-fiction book of 2023. But, like him, I’m a little in love with this guide to the most practised (and overlooked) British folk art of the past 90 years. Bingham is an authority on Anglican church canvas-work kneelers, and in her lovely book she traces their history from their beginnings in 1930s Winchester, through their zenith after the coronation of Elizabeth II, to the present day, in which a dedicated few keep the tradition alive. Kneelers celebrate and memorialise every aspect of life, not only the religious – though Bible stories do feature, if you’re in the market for a tapestry of Jonah and the whale – and this makes them both touching and surprising. My favourites so far: a grey whippet (St Peter and St Paul, Deddington); a Second World War ARP warden fighting a fire (St Mary Magdalene, Woodstock); Sizewell nuclear power station in the sunshine (St Edmunds, Southwold). , Water pollution, quack! Cost of living crisis, Quack! Strikes, quack! • You can order your own version of this cartoon , Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer’s comedy nails the alchemy of what turns the private into the hilariously relatableI realise this says more about me, but my instinctive response to hearing about a real-life couple doing a comedy show together is usually a rapid sinking of the heart. It’s a scepticism born of too many evenings with coupled-up friends who collapse into spasms of laughter every time someone says “couscous”, and then pretend-apologise by exchanging a special glance and saying: “Sorry, it’s hard to explain, it’s just… we have a thing about couscous.” Yes, hilarious. Frequently, what couples find funny together fails to translate outside that context, and can often feel exclusionary – which, after all, is the point of a private joke: this is our thing, you wouldn’t get it because you weren’t there. So the prospect of that in sitcom form doesn’t inspire confidence. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was a recording of a meeting of the AI in weapons systems select committee of the House of Lords, which was set up to inquire into “how should autonomous weapons be developed, used and regulated”. The particular session I was interested in was the one held on 20 April, during which the committee heard from four expert witnesses – Kenneth Payne, who is professor of strategy at King’s College London; Keith Dear, director of artificial intelligence innovation at the computer company Fujitsu; James Black from the defence and security research group of Rand Europe; and Courtney Bowman, global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering at Palantir UK. An interesting mix, I thought – and so it turned out to be. Autonomous weapons systems are ones that can select and attack a target without human intervention. It is believed (and not just by their boosters) that these systems could revolutionise warfare, and may be faster, more accurate and more resilient than existing weapons systems. And that they could, conceivably, even limit the casualties of war (though I’ll believe that when I see it). , Conservationists in the Brazilian Amazon are using a new tool to predict the next sites of deforestation – and it may prove a gamechanger in the war on logging It took just the month of March this year to fell an area of forest in Triunfo do Xingu equivalent to 700 football pitches. At more than 16,000 sq km, this Environmental Protection Area (APA) in the south-eastern corner of the Brazilian Amazon, in the state of Pará, is one of the largest conservation areas in the world. And according to a new tool that predicts where deforestation will happen next, it’s also the APA at highest risk of even more destruction. The tool, PrevisIA, is an artificial intelligence platform created by researchers at environmental nonprofit Imazon. Instead of trying to repair damage done by deforestation after the fact, they wanted to find a way to prevent it from happening at all. , National Crime Agency assessing risk after data of some National Smallbore Rifle Association members ‘compromised’ Police are investigating a cyber-attack involving potentially thousands of British gun owners, raising concerns that organised criminals may target them for firearms. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is assessing the level of risk after the National Smallbore Rifle Association (NSRA) confirmed that data belonging to some of its members had been “compromised”. ,  68-year-old presenter to step down at the end of season ‘It is now the right time to move on. It’s been a lot of fun’ Jeff Stelling has confirmed he will leave Soccer Saturday at the end of the season after more than 25 years presenting the show. It is not the first time the 68-year-old has announced he would stepping down but Stelling has promised he will not change his mind on this occasion. Stelling previously claimed he would leave Sky Sports at the end of last season but decided to stay on for another year. , White House announces offenders to be moved to home confinement and they will not have to pay remainder of fines President Joe Biden has ordered the federal prison sentences of 31 people to be reduced, punishments which were given to them after nonviolent drug-related convictions. In an announcement released on Friday, the White House revealed that those whose sentences were commuted would be under home confinement until a 30 June expiration date for their respective punishments. The plan is for them to then be on supervised release, with the duration of that based on their original sentence. , Health ministry gives green light for two-step treatment to end pregnancies up to nine weeks The abortion pill is to become available in Japan for the first time after the health ministry approved a drug used to terminate early-stage pregnancies. Abortion is legal in Japan up to 22 weeks, but consent is usually required from a spouse or partner, and until now a surgical procedure had been the only option. , Police are searching for suspect in after shooting in Cleveland, in which one of the victims was an eight-year-old child After neighbors complained about the noise he was making, a Texas man went next door with an AR-15-style rifle and shot them, killing five people – including an eight-year-old child – as well as wounding three others at a home in Cleveland, Texas, on Friday night.

When she met Sam, she had to double down on self-denial  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email There’s a photo of Sam and me, taken on the night we first met. It was 2012 at the Sydney theatre awards; he had been nominated for best actor and I was someone’s plus one. We must have met at the drinks afterwards because we’re both there in this group shot. I didn’t even remember it. A few months later we ended up working on a development week for a play.

A win for the Spiders will take them above Dundee, who could only draw with relegation-threatened Cove Rangers at Dens last night, and ensure that a draw in their final game - at home to Dundee - will mean the league title and promotion to the Scottish Premier. Even defeat to Morton, who themselves are still in with a chance of making the play-offs, will set things up for a winner takes all match between the top two next week. It’s also the first leg of the play-off between The Spartans and Brechin, Lowland and Highland league winners respectively, to see who will go forward to play for a place in the Scottish League against the team finishing at the bottom of Scottish League Two (currently Albion Rovers). So all to play for. They don’t call it the business end of the season for nothing, I suppose.” … so the Premier League table now looks like this, for the next couple of hours anyway. If Palace had any lingering relegation fears, they’re conclusively gone now. Mr Roy’s done quite the job there. West Ham will still be looking over their shoulder, and though their run-in isn’t the easiest, with games against both Manchester clubs and trips to Brentford and Leicester coming up, the fact they’re not shy of scoring goals should see them all right: they’ve now scored 14 in their last five matches. ,  Day three from the latest round of the County Championship Sign up for The Spin | And mail Tanya, tweet her or post BTL I think we can safely now say that Ben Compton is not a one-season wonder.

Brighton have made a raft of changes, their squad knackered and dejected after defeats in the FA Cup semi-final and away at Nottingham Forest. Alexis Mac Allister, Kaoru Mitoma, Moises Caicedo, Levi Colwill and Facundo Buonanotte all start on the bench, with Danny Welbeck, Adam Webster, Joel Veltman, Deniz Undav and the lesser-spotted Billy Gilmour stepping up. Wolves just make two tweaks to the side that started the 2-0 won over Crystal Palace during the week: Joao Gomes and Pedro Neto step up, Hwang Hee-Chan and Matheus Cunha step down. Brentford, on a high after winning at Chelsea, switch things around a bit too. Aaron Hickey, Mikkel Damsgaard, Kevin Schade and Bryan Mbeumo replace Mads Roerslev, Mathias Jorgensen, Frank Onyeka and Yoane Wissa. Forest make one change after their win against Brighton, and it’s forced upon them: Joe Worrall deputises for Neco Williams, who suffered a broken jaw during the midweek game. ,  Day three from the latest round of the County Championship Sign up for The Spin | And mail Tanya, tweet her or post BTL I think we can safely now say that Ben Compton is not a one-season wonder.

Pity poor Barry Glendenning’s fingers! There’s already been one big result today, and it’s come in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup: Falkirk 0-3 Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Billy Mckay opened the scoring with a seventh-minute penalty, and closed it on 57 with a fine cushioned volley that took his all-time ICT tally to 100. In between times, Daniel MacKay steered in a fine header. Caley Thistle will face either Celtic or Rangers in the final.

residents to understand that one could come anywhere  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates Huddled under a blanket, Iryna Babii turned away from the empty space where, until Friday, nine floors of apartments had been stacked, one of them home to her daughter’s best friend. The apartments were obliterated when a Russian missile crashed into this residential block, which sits beside a school in a neighbourhood just near the botanical gardens of Uman, a central Ukrainian city that before the war was known mostly as a Jewish pilgrimage site. , People turn to handouts and pawning goods as Kyiv’s bustling bars belie reality of life in wartime for many In the Treasure pawn shop in Kyiv, Oleksandra, 40, a well turned out woman in a hooded wool coat and Nike trainers, has come to redeem her sewing machines. Like all those visiting the store, she does not want to give her family name. She says that when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, she was working as an accountant for a firm that employed 14 people, who were all laid off because of the conflict. Since then she has struggled to find regular work. With savings running out, like many others in Kyiv, she turned to pawning her possessions to get by, only finding a job a year later that allowed her to claim back her machines. , High-ranking government members hope to make political capital out of their own failures. Labour must reject this cynicism In a fortnight’s time, a remarkable two-day political conference is going to be happening in central London. The people speaking in its debates and discussions come almost entirely from the political right: they will include the home secretary, Suella Braverman, her cabinet colleague Michael Gove, and a host of voices from media outlets such as the Daily Telegraph and GB News. What will sit at the heart of proceedings, says the event’s official blurb, are “the idea of the nation” and “the revival of the unique national traditions that alone have the power to bind a people together and bring about their flourishing”. The foes and bugbears that will be decried include “political theories grounded in race”, and “a powerful new Marxism”. , UK policy is to ensure its industry doesn’t suffer collateral damage in the contest for tech supremacy Rishi Sunak is readying a billion pounds to subsidise the UK’s fledgling microchip industry. It sounds big. But the British government is merely reacting to US economic warfare against China. Behind the talk of “friendshoring” and resurgent industrial policy is a struggle to avoid collateral damage in the battle between China and the US for tech supremacy. The EU plans almost to match the US promise of $52bn (£42bn) in chip subsidies. India is spending $30bn (£25bn) on its semiconductor mission. Mr Sunak looks to be bringing a peashooter to a gunfight. But Britain does not have a complete end-to-end chip supply chain nor does it aspire to have one. Instead, it is following the slipstream of US power. Washington’s strength is that almost all chip factories contain critical tools from US suppliers. The US has isolated Beijing with export control powers that ban transactions between foreign countries and China. Washington’s legislative arsenal was first deployed against China’s Huawei, whose products Britain has also decided to ban. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More will be needed Social security is an investment in people, yet politicians in England have often treated it as a handout that should be almost impossible to survive on. The Scottish government has taken a different attitude. In place of George Osborne’s two-child limit on benefits, it has established a new weekly payment of £25 for each child. To mitigate the bedroom tax, it introduced discretionary housing payments. While the Department for Work and Pensions rolled out huge changes to benefits without consulting those who use them, Scotland commissioned “experience panels” to involve people in the design of policies. Despite these laudable attempts to ease the pain of Westminster’s swingeing cuts, the longer story of poverty in Scotland is one of bleak contradictions. As new research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) shows, while overall poverty levels have fallen, the number of people in very deep poverty has grown dramatically. Over the past two decades, a population the size of Dundee has been pushed into extreme poverty (households with less than 40% of the median income). People in this group are more likely to be single adults, from minority ethnic backgrounds, or disabled. Many of the causes – such as low-paid jobs – are national phenomena. Destitution is rising across Britain. But its increase in Scotland should also be a warning about how policies are targeted. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was not established primarily or directly to improve schools or the system generally. It aimed to provide impartial, independent, professionally subjective judgments to assist leaders, governors and teachers in evaluating their policies and provision so as to help determine priorities for development. It was for schools to consider the inspection findings and commendations, not to necessarily accept them all. That original limited but valuable purpose has been forgotten, even corrupted, and overtaken by more grandiose claims. Ofsted is now viewed by its leaders and supporters as providing authoritative, “objective”, incontestable findings and recommendations that have to be acted on. Its detractors contest these claims as unwarranted and overblown. Any reform of the system would do well to recognise the value of the limited purposes set out in the original legislation.Prof Colin RichardsFormer HM inspector of schools, Spark Bridge, Cumbria , Readers say Conservative candidates appear to be distancing themselves from the governing party Alison Hallum and Brian Sandall (Letters, 25 April and 26 April) might be interested to know that Conservatives are also disappearing in Milton Keynes. None of their leaflets mention the party, and they’re on the nomination list as “Local Conservatives”. This is a clear attempt at distancing themselves from the governing party, though it appears well-coordinated by campaign headquarters. Friends tell me they are seeing similar in many other areas.Paul Norris Olney, Buckinghamshire • In our Tory stronghold we have had no posters or literature from the party. We note from our local paper, the Hereford Times, that they are styling themselves as “Local Conservatives”. Have they even here despaired of their own government?Margaret and Les BarclayLeominster, Herefordshire ,  Klopp: ‘I really don’t know what Tierney has against us’ Spurs’ Ryan Mason feels Diogo Jota deserved red card Jürgen Klopp accused the referee Paul Tierney of holding a grudge against Liverpool and of speaking out of turn during his team’s thrilling stoppage‑time victory over Tottenham. Klopp was booked by Tierney for sprinting up to the face of fourth official John Brooks when celebrating Diogo Jota’s 94th‑minute winner at Anfield, which came 99 seconds after Richarlison appeared to have completed Spurs’ comeback from three goals down. ,  ‘It’s a big disaster, a crazy moment’ says shaken Ocon Pérez holds off Verstappen in Red Bull one-two “Expect the unexpected”, proclaimed the banners adorning the streets of Baku for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. An entreaty that proved to be wishful thinking at best for all but the final moments of the race, when a near-disaster in the form of an astonishingly dangerous incident proved as entirely unanticipated as it was unwelcome. Sergio Pérez might have taken the win for Red Bull but the meeting was marked by the sight of personnel gathered in the pit lane scattering in panic as Esteban Ocon’s car bore down on them, putting Formula One and the FIA’s safety procedures under enormous scrutiny. , Fulham did expose one weakness but Pep Guardiola’s relentless side shrugged it off to go top of the Premier League Tick. Tick. Tick. At the end of this breezy, fun, quietly feisty 2-1 defeat of Fulham, there was even a sense of super-smart design in Pep Guardiola’s onfield displays of affection. There was a double-hug for John Stones: both hands around the torso plus a final flurry of buttock pats for the key defensive peg on the current eight-match winning league run. Guardiola hugged Jack Grealish, just because he loves hugging Jack Grealish. ,  Semi-final: La Rochelle 47-28 Exeter Holders score seven tries to reach third successive final So much for Exeter’s Last Dance. This was a waltz for La Rochelle, a walloping for the Chiefs. They had hoped to wave goodbye to so many departing club stalwarts in style this season but the brutal reality is they were steamrollered by a La Rochelle side who blend power and panache to devastating effect and are now into their third successive Champions Cup final. Grégory Alldritt produced the kind of performance that made him Europe’s premier back-rower not so long ago but La Rochelle’s dominance was all over the pitch – the outside centre UJ Seuteni particularly catching the eye – as they ran in seven tries. , Institute of Directors index returns to levels last seen just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 Business confidence has increased for the fifth month in a row, according to a regular health-check by bosses’ lobby group the Institute of Directors. The IoD’s “economic confidence index”, which surveys company directors on issues such as the wider economy and their own plans for hiring and investment, rose to -5 in April, up from -13 the previous month. , Complexity of system and perception of government handouts as ‘shameful’ stopping people from accessing much-needed support Millions of UK households are collectively missing out on at least £19bn a year in unclaimed welfare benefits, at a time when many are forced to use food banks or run up debt as they struggle with rising living costs, according to new estimates. Lower income households are failing to claim benefits and other cash support for which they are eligible, according to a study by the consultancy Policy in Practice. Some families could be forgoing as much as £4,000 a year. , Tax Justice Network says monarch can lead push to revamp laws allowing ‘industrial scale avoidance’ totalling £152bn a year King Charles has been urged to call for the breakup of the “UK’s network of satellite tax havens” through which an estimated £152bn worth of tax is avoided every year, according to campaigners. Tax Justice Network, a coalition of researchers and activists campaigning against tax avoidance, are today calling on King Charles to use his reign as monarch to call for a revamp of laws that allow industrial scale tax avoidance in the UK, the crown dependencies and the British overseas territories. , Invoice for ex-PM’s time at Kent mansion when foreign secretary is thought to include sums for missing bathrobes and party business Liz Truss is disputing part of a £12,000 bill sent to her by the Cabinet Office relating to her use of the grace-and-favour Chevening house while she was foreign secretary. The bill mostly covered hospitality but also included missing items, such as some bathrobes, and dates back to last summer when she was fighting the Conservative leadership campaign against Rishi Sunak. , Nurses union head clashes with Steve Barclay over plans to protect patients and RMT rows with Mark Harper about striking on eve of Eurovision final The Royal College of Nursing has clashed with the government over whether sufficient exemptions have been made to protect patient safety during the nurses’ strike in England that started on Sunday evening. The clash came as a row erupted between the leader of the train drivers’ union and the transport secretary, who had criticised a planned strike on the eve of the Eurovision song contest final for its impact on Ukraine. , Opposition leader says party would change current system, in which PM has final say on who gets job Keir Starmer has said Labour would make sure the BBC chair is independently appointed after Richard Sharp’s resignation following his failure to declare that he had helped Boris Johnson get a loan. The Labour leader suggested the party would reform the system, in which the prime minister currently has the final say on who gets the job. , Local man aged 24 arrested in Bodmin on multiple charges following knife attack A man has died and seven others were left injured after a stabbing near a nightclub in Cornwall. Police were called to Castle Canyke Road in the Victoria Square area in Bodmin at 3.15am on Sunday after reports of a person with a knife and multiple people with suspected stab wounds. , Boat with 38 people onboard got into difficulty in Channel and left to drift back towards France, FOI request shows A boat carrying 38 people, including children, that got into difficulty crossing the Channel was not rescued when it reached UK waters but was instead allowed to drift back towards France, according to internal maritime logs. Ministry of Defence officials, who were managing small boats in the Channel at the time, told the Guardian in January that they disputed that the stricken dinghy had entered UK waters. , FBI says it has ‘zero leads’ after two days of searching for suspect in fatal shooting of neighbors after noise complaint The man suspected of killing five people, including a nine-year-old boy, with an AR-15-style weapon after neighbors asked him to stop shooting in his yard could be anywhere by now, authorities in Houston, Texas, have said. More than 200 police from multiple jurisdictions were involved in the search for 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza as the FBI acknowledged it had “zero leads” nearly two days after the shooting occurred near the town of Cleveland, about 45 miles north of Houston. Authorities put up $80,000 in reward money for information about his whereabouts. A previous version of this story, based on information from the FBI, incorrectly stated the age of Daniel Enrique Laso as eight years old. His father said the boy was nine. , Hospitals, morgues and burial grounds under pressure, with more than 300 bodies found this year in just one region Authorities in Tunisia are considering building new cemeteries, as the country runs out of space to bury the dozens of refugees washing up every day on its shores. The first three months of 2023 were the deadliest for people attempting to cross the central Mediterranean since 2017, according to the UN, with an increasing number of boats carrying asylum seekers wrecked at sea. , According to the comedian’s hilarious new show, the royals are a crime syndicate we should throw molotov cocktails at – or replace with a constitution. That’s how you tell truth to power! ‘You’d think Prince Andrew would apologise,” says Frankie Boyle. He’s midway through his timely lament about what he takes to be the misogynistic, thick, inegalitarian non-entities of Britain’s monarchy, shortly before the fatuous institution’s continued existence is solemnised with Charles III’s coronation. “I apologise after consensual sex.” And yet, for all the Glaswegian comedian’s republican posturing, there is a queasy sense that if Prince Andrew didn’t exist, Boyle would have to invent him. The Duke of York is the comedy gift that keeps giving. Symbols are important to the royal brand, Boyle tells us. Consider Prince Charles’s crest before he became King. It “shows a lion mounting another lion while a horse looks patiently on. Whereas the Duke of York’s shows a lion paying £12m to a sex-trafficked lion cub the lion claims he never met.” , A powerful new weight-loss medication may be approved for those aged 12 to 17. But healthcare professionals fear it ignores the underlying socioeconomic causes Like many GPs around the UK, Semiya Aziz has grown accustomed to seeing children as young as four or five who are obese. Knowing how best to address this delicate and complex issue with parents, given the time constraints of a 10-minute consultation, is a challenge for GPs, who are increasingly shouldering the burden of the UK’s burgeoning child obesity crisis. “It’s very difficult to actually say, ‘Look, your child is overweight and needs to go on a programme,’” says Aziz, whose practice is in Palmers Green, north London. “There’s a big taboo with discussing it, as parents don’t want to upset their children. And GPs don’t have time in a short consultation to get those educational measures about healthy lifestyles across and delve into the child’s habits.” , UK Ministry of Defence reports that Russian commanders have likely started punishing discipline breaches by detaining troops in ‘Zindans’ Shelling through the night in the city of Kherson has injured two people, deputy head of Kherson Oblast Council Yuriy Sobolevsky said this morning. More than 27 attacks were reported on residential areas of the wider Kherson region on Saturday, according to its authorities, with some 135 shells fired. ,  Nepo and Liren play four 25+10 games to decide champion Tweet Bryan at @BryanAGraham or email him The eval bar goes back to dead even after Ding’s 23.

The government announced mission accomplished last week on its manifesto commitment to recruit 20,000 extra coppers. Labour hit back, saying this was just reversing the government’s own cuts since 2010. The reality is somewhere in between: there has now been an increase in police numbers since 2010, but we’re talking 3,500, not 20,000, and forces have grown more slowly than the populations they police. , Kiln; Almeida; Dorfman, LondonIn his quickfire new McCarthy-era play, For Black Boys… creator Ryan Calais Cameron speaks his mind; a civil rights musical buzzes with potential; and Deborah Bruce’s domestic abuse drama is full of surprises I have always assumed that one chief sign of a strong dramatist was instant recognisability. Yet Ryan Calais Cameron is proving his talent by showing how elastic it is. His astonishing For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy, now wowing the West End, is intense, inward – and danced as much as spoken. His new play is utterly different: socially engaged, skilfully recreating a historic encounter and driven by rapid-fire dialogue. Opening in the week of Harry Belafonte’s death, Amit Sharma’s fleet production of Retrograde strikes with particular force. Set in the 50s, the action draws on the real-life hounding of black actors during the McCarthyite era, in particular the pressure – essentially, do this or you won’t work – put on Sidney Poitier to denounce the glorious singer, actor and campaigner Paul Robeson. , Fresh vibrant flavours to welcome the spring into your kitchen The words, chalked in upper case on a grey board, greet me from afar: CARLINGFORD OYSTERS. CORNISH MACKEREL. For once, my mind is made up even before I set foot in the shop. I glance at some tempting sea bass and a bag of tiny mussels, shells closed tight, but I go with the recommendation. You learn to trust your local shopkeepers. I do almost nothing with the oysters save a tiny squeeze of lemon. They have a briny, slap-you-in-the-face freshness and set us up for a fish supper of grilled mackerel with cider vinegar and paprika, and a plume of grilled spring onions. I sometimes struggle to get mackerel off the bars of the griddle, so decide to cook it with heat from above, under the oven grill. The fillets are turned halfway through, to crisp the skin, something I relish, even if others don’t. , UK Ministry of Defence reports that Russian commanders have likely started punishing discipline breaches by detaining troops in ‘Zindans’ Shelling through the night in the city of Kherson has injured two people, deputy head of Kherson Oblast Council Yuriy Sobolevsky said this morning.

Specifically, his two primary options of Qa4 or g5. , The home secretary is emboldening the far right by pointing the finger at ethnic groupsIn a recent Spectator column, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, claimed that by highlighting the Pakistani ethnicity of grooming gang members in a “string of cases”, she was merely pointing out “unfashionable facts”. Yet why zero in on a string of cases that received extensive media coverage, rather than acknowledging the full scale of the problem based on the data we have about all such cases? To learn that half a million British children are sexually abused each year should drive us to anger and action. We are right to want to know how to tackle a problem taking place on such a vast national scale. But we cannot tackle a problem if we fail to truly see what that problem is. And that means seeing it through the lens of fact. , Conservative candidates in this week’s polls include several who were reinstated after accusations of racism and Islamophobia Five Conservative councillors standing for the party in this week’s local elections in England, have been suspended for alleged racism and Islamophobia in recent years – including one who suggested banning mosques and another who accused Muslims of being on a “quest to turn the world Muslim”. They are among 13 councillors identified by the Observer, drawing on research by the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, who have been suspended over racist comments and social media posts in the past four years before being reinstated. , Last flight left on Saturday night following evacuation of nearly 1,900 people and amid concerns Sudan’s army had blocked some from leaving The final UK flight taking evacuees from Sudan left on Saturday night, the UK government has said, marking the end of Britain’s evacuation operation from the country stricken by warring armed forces. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the last flight left Wadi Saeedna airfield, just north of the capital, Khartoum, at 10pm local time and that the UK is no longer running evacuation flights from the airfield. , Top gardeners advise use of tougher varieties that can cope with extremes of heat and cold as conditions disappoint growers Gardeners are being urged to grow plants that can cope with extreme heat and cold after the Royal Horticultural Society was bombarded with letters from members asking why species they had cultivated successfully for years were now dying. “It seems to be because of the temperature fluctuations,” said Nikki Barker, a senior horticultural adviser at the RHS. “We’ve gone from severe drought with an initially very mild autumn that turned cold. It’s the combination of weather patterns rather than one single event. And plants find it hard to deal with that fluctuation.” , Staff warn vulnerable children may be harmed as they struggle to find placements after 28 homes given deadline to shut by chain One of the UK’s largest for-profit care chains has been accused of failing dozens of vulnerable children by shutting 28 residential homes, with staff warning they are struggling to find placements for all the children. Outcomes First Group, which is owned by private equity firm Stirling Square, is planning to close a string of children’s homes across the Midlands and southern England by 5 May. The homes are understood to accommodate more than 60 children, placed in the care of the private group by councils including Bristol, Cheshire and Enfield in London. , With concern among allies seemingly growing, there is a lot riding on an imminent counter-assault on the Russians in the south  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates The last time “Luh” served in the military, he was a Soviet conscript, sailing the Arctic Ocean with the USSR’s northern fleet over four decades ago. When Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed proxies moved into his home region of Luhansk nearly a decade ago, he cheered on the Ukrainian army but thought his fighting days were behind him. , Coastguard agency says fire was extinguished and all 60 passengers were evacuated safe and well Passengers on a ferry to Orkney had to be evacuated and taken ashore by lifeboat after the vessel ran aground in what was described as “a major incident”. All 60 passengers, including three children and a baby, were said to be safe and well after the incident in Scapa Flow on Saturday evening. , President says island is only receiving two-thirds of the petrol it needs as queues outside gas stations stretch miles There was a time when International Workers’ Day was marked in Cuba by parades involving millions of people marching through Havana’s Revolution Square. Many came out of conviction, some because they were pressured, others to enjoy the party. This Monday, however, the square will be empty, after the Cuban Communist party cancelled this year’s celebrations due to gasoline shortages that are crippling the island’s economy. , Consumers are being ‘misled’ into believing dairy cattle graze in fields, says  animal rights campaign Some of the UK’s biggest food firms are accused of misleading consumers after buying their milk from intensive industrial dairy units despite using images to promote their products that show cows grazing in green fields. Tens of thousands of dairy cattle in England are kept in hangar-style sheds with no or very limited access to pasture. They will typically be milked three times daily, often on large electronic rotating milk parlours, producing up to 32 litres of milk each day. , Department of Health asks watchdog to assess effectiveness of giving semaglutide to obese youngsters aged 12 to 17 Children as young as 12 in England could be given weight-loss injections on the NHS after the government asked medical watchdog Nice to assess the potential benefits of prescribing them to under-18s. Department of Health officials have asked the watchdog to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of giving semaglutide injections to obese children aged 12 to 17, “in addition to healthy nutrition and increased physical activity”, the Observer can reveal. , The symbol of antisocial behaviour is back in the limelight as one London borough outlaws it It’s not hard to spot a hoodie in Romford in east London – hooded tops have become almost as ubiquitous as jeans around the UK. So a new rule banning anyone from putting up their hoods in the town centre’s shopping areas has not gone down well with some. “It’s the most stupid thing I’ve ever heard in my life,” says Mohamed Amraoui, a 24-year-old prison officer. , UK Ministry of Defence reports that Russian commanders have likely started punishing discipline breaches by detaining troops in ‘Zindans’ There have been reports of heavy shelling in the Kharkiv region this morning. Several homes in the city of Kupyansk have been hit with anti-aircraft missiles, according to local officials. The hit caused fires at residential houses and garages and four cars were destroyed, but there were no casualties, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration. , US president says he is ‘working like hell’ to secure release of Wall Street Journal reporter held in Russia on espionage charges Joe Biden has praised the “absolute courage” of Evan Gershkovich, the US journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges, and reiterated calls on Moscow for his immediate release. The US president said the Wall Street Journal reporter, who is the first correspondent since the cold war to be detained in Russia on spying charges, sought to “shed light on the darkness” of the country and said American efforts to get him home would not cease. , Crimea navy oil depot fire extinguished after reported Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks; Nancy Pelosi speaks about her ‘dangerous’ Kyiv visit  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage , At 24, Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold has the world at his feet. But many thousands make the same sacrifices only to be dropped at the last moment – sometimes with tragic consequences. Here, he reveals why he’s working to support ex-academy players Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to make clear he has absolutely no regrets about his path to the Premier League. He’s about to recount memories of extreme pressure and major sacrifice. And, really, he’s not complaining. “I’m a success story,” he says, in a soft scouse accent, not boastful. “I look back and I’m proud. I got here through hard work and discipline.” At 24, he has already banked a lifetime of financial and vocational achievements. But he is a rare exception. And for the past few years, that fact has been troubling him. Like the vast majority of top-flight professional players in the UK and beyond, Alexander-Arnold came up through a football academy. Across the country, around 12,000 boys aged eight and up are enrolled in these training schemes (boys and girls can start training with clubs from as young as five years old). Professional clubs scout young players and help them develop towards the adult game. Around 3,500 boys are currently signed to Premier League academies, but over 99% of children signed to an academy aged nine won’t have a professional footballing career. “There were players who were faster and stronger than me who didn’t make it,” Alexander-Arnold tells. “I’m not moaning about it. I’m not saying I don’t deserve it. But I played with hundreds of kids growing up. Against thousands. What would have happened if it hadn’t worked out for me?” , This family-run Greek restaurant serves up so much more than just classic dishes Alexandros Greek Restaurant &amp; Deli, 68 Warwick Road, Carlisle CA1 1DR (01228 592227). Starters £5.75-£9.95, mains £14.50-£28.50, desserts £7.50, wines from £21 Lots of restaurants can be full on a Thursday and Friday night. Lots of restaurants can smash it on a Saturday. That’s not how you make a living. To make a living, you have to be full on a Wednesday lunchtime. This Wednesday lunchtime, Alexandros is doing trade of which others can only dream. “It was even busier yesterday,” says Aris Pathanoglou, who owns the place with his wife, Sarah, when I comment on the bustle and hum. It’s an older crowd, the sort who can find space on a weekday for a proper lunch, as long as it’s reliable, and yes, we will have a whole bottle, thanks. Alexandros, a venerable Greek restaurant, which has been feeding the good and greedy of Carlisle for more than two decades, is clearly very reliable. , The distinguished historian and headteacher discusses his latest book about a contemporary prime minister, a devastating – and dispiriting – account of Johnson’s chaotic reign  Andrew Rawnsley reviews Johnson at 10 by Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell Sir Anthony Seldon, the famous headteacher, has been writing book-length report cards on British prime ministers for 40 years. The latest, on Boris Johnson, based on the accounts of more than 200 people who witnessed his catastrophic, clown-car time in office first-hand, is a test not only of Seldon’s method, but also his tone. In previous volumes the author has assumed a base level of gravitas in his subjects, and of structure in their government. Though he employs the same quasi-legal model for his inquiry here, gathering careful evidence, weighing judgments, the story he pieces together is often one of venal mayhem; it frequently reads like a considered constitutional appraisal of rats in a sack. There is a telling coincidence in the fact that the first indelible report of Johnson’s behaviour was also the work of a school master. Martin Hammond’s infamous notes on Johnson at Eton, which recorded his “disgracefully cavalier attitude”, his “gross failure of responsibility” and his deep-seated belief that he “should be free of the network of obligation that binds everyone else” is the opening source of Seldon’s account. Johnson’s “end was in his beginning”, he argues. Speaking to me about his book last week, Seldon noted that Hammond – who had been the “formidable pipe-smoking” head at Tonbridge school when he started out as a teacher – was a longstanding inspiration, both as an educator and a writer. “Two things,” he says. “One is that his report was typically acute and detailed, like a psychiatrist’s analysis. And second: just how much the character is formed very early on.” , On his wedding day, Tim Sullivan’s much-loved dad suddenly collapsed and died on what should have been the happiest of days. But what he learned has shaped his life It was all set to be one of the happiest days of my life, 9 September 1989. I was getting married. Everything leading up to the date had gone smoothly. The wedding was taking place in a small church, St Teilo’s in Bishopston Valley on the Gower peninsula. About 130 friends and family had made the trip down to South Wales. After the ceremony, Rachel and I were going to process up the hill from the church to the reception at my in-laws’ home, led by a small jazz band and followed by our guests. But as we left the church, my father suddenly collapsed and died in my arms. He was 65, exactly the age I am now as I write this. It’s a moment I remember vividly. A moment that affected what I went on to write about in my career and how I wrote it. A moment that demonstrated how tragic things have a habit of occurring at the happiest and most unexpected of times. , The 80-year-old US president chooses annual address to have some fun with a crucial voter concern, mixed with digs at Don Lemon and Fox News Age shall not weary him, but it might provide some good punchlines. Joe Biden, the oldest president in American history, faced his biggest political liability with a smile on Saturday as he addressed a gathering of Washington’s political and media elites. , Punk rock exploded in 1977 with a raw power seldom seen since. But Johnny Rotten (as he used to call himself) is 67 now, and most of his fans from that time are in their 60s. So what became of all that energy, spiky hair and safety-pins? Mark Jordan enjoys walking around his Welsh home town “got up like a Christmas tree” in vintage Vivienne Westwood bondage shirts and bright blue brothel creepers. “The other day, I was stopped by this young guy walking the dog, he was wide-eyed and said, ‘What is that you’re wearing?’” Jordan says. “His eyes were on sticks when I told him that some of this old punk gear is worth thousands.” A teen of the late 1970s, punk was Jordan’s escape from growing up on a drab Merseyside council estate through an economic recession. It was a wild time, Jordan, now 61, recalls, though nothing like the handed-down caricatures of punk anarchy today. “It wasn’t all sitting in doorways drinking lager with a dog on a string,” he explains. “Johnny Rotten said, ‘Get off your arse!’ – don’t sit on it. Punk was always more about outrageousness and embracing life.” , Outdoor pianos, celebrity names and free tuition videos combine to get Britons tickling the ivories once more For years, it seemed like the piano was disappearing from British public life. The bulky instruments were cast out of homes and schools and offered for free online. But now – despite all the digital entertainment alternatives and conductor Simon Rattle’s stark warning last week that UK classical music was fighting for its life amid funding cuts – the piano seems to be making a 21st-century comeback in homes, on streets and online. , Your husband is breaking promises and not listening to you. You’re hurt and frustrated, and desperate for things to change, but don’t act in haste or rageThe dilemma I am 47, have two primary-school children and a marriage that is in slow decline. From our initial pre-marriage ideals of a kind of Scandinavian shared approach to parenting and marriage it became apparent that, in fact, our underlying approach was that of his parents. The expectation is that I do everything. Nothing is done in an abusive way, but there is a passive detachment which I see in him that mirrors his dad. In his side of the family, the women run around doing everything while the men watch TV and discuss the news. I have brought this up numerous times, both in frustration and anger and in calmer, sadder moments. My husband will acknowledge this when I am calmer and will try to be more of an equal partner, but after a short time everything falls back to how it has been. I often think about being single. I am not interested in being with another man, but sometimes I find myself wondering if I would have a more equal relationship with a woman. I don’t want to break up because of our children. I have talked with him about splitting up, but he only laughs. Do I stay married? Or should I get out? ,  Nepo and Liren play four 25+10 games to decide champion Tweet Bryan at @BryanAGraham or email him Another flurry of moves: 7. Bg2 O-O 8. b4 Ng4 9. Bd4 Qc7 10. O-O e5 11. h3 exd4 12. hxg4 dxc3 13. Nxc4 Nxb4 14. a3 Bf6. Interestingly, it’s Nepomniachtchi who has fallen about five minutes behind on the clock early on after Ding has spent most of the past three weeks under time pressure. The Chinese challenger’s preparation for today’s first game has been spot-on. The first rapid game is under way and Ding goes with the trusty Queen’s Pawn opening (1. d4). They blitz out the opening moves from there (1. ... Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c3 c5 4. dxc5 e6 5. Be3 Be7 6. g3 Nc6). Nepomniachtchi with an early pawn sacrifice. ,  Brecel wins 11 straight frames in greatest Crucible fightback Allen wins five in row from 16-10 down before also losing 17-15 Luca Brecel produced the greatest ever Crucible comeback as he won 11 frames in a row against Si Jiahui while Mark Selby held off a Mark Allen fightback in a match that finished after midnight to set up a mouthwatering World Snooker Championship final. After the amazing comeback in the afternoon by Brecel, it looked as if there could be another as Allen, trailing 16-10, started pegging Selby back. The Northern Irishman won five frames in a row and his opponent, a four-time world champion, was looking jittery but managed to get over the line 17-15 at 12.45am. , British player’s astonishing US Open triumph seems all the more surprising given injury problems she has suffered since As the players settled in Madrid for the fourth ATP Masters 1000 event of the season, one competitor was extremely unsettled. In her pre-tournament press conference on Tuesday, Emma Raducanu entered the room determined to keep every response as short as possible. One-word answers were preferred. Her day’s work came in at 58 words. Eventually, the moderator recognised the futility of continuing and aborted her media briefing. The spectacle was concerning. The past 18 months have been difficult for various reasons and Britain’s young hope has become increasingly guarded, but the positive perspective she had tried to exude in public for much of this period was gone. , Ticket prices are proving an expense too far and some fans are ditching the Premier League for local community clubs As the season draws to a close, and the cost of living crisis continues to bite, football fans will be thinking about the expense of attending regular matches. In Germany, Fortuna Düsseldorf last week said they would offer free tickets to supporters, but how are English clubs responding to financial pressures on their fanbase? According to the Office for National Statistics, 38% of adults are spending more on everyday items. For match-goers, ticket prices are often proving an expense too far. , Sexual harassment is another workplace abuse that once seen as trivial, but not any more First, there were the CBI allegations. “Everyone should be bullied once in their lifetime,” an employee was allegedly told during a “campaign of verbal abuse” at the organisation. There was Dominic Raab’s indignant resignation – he had rashly promised in advance to accept the findings of a bullying inquiry against him, only to find that in the event he didn’t accept them at all. And now new bullying allegations are surfacing, this time around the health secretary, Steve Barclay. , The public interest requires an open and scrupulous process to find the person best suited to perform an important role in our national lifeThat’s a blow for the theory of nominative determinism. Richard Sharp was terribly dim when it came to realising that he could not possibly continue as chair of the BBC. A magician he may have been at making money at Goldman Sachs, and a wizard operator at forging political connections, and some at the broadcaster thought him a capable chair, but he was a fool to think that he could somehow ride out the storm. When he finally announced his resignation on Friday, departing with some chaff about not wanting to be a “distraction”, this was long after it was obvious that he was fatally compromised. “It was inevitable,” says a former Conservative cabinet minister. “Everyone could see how this was going to end,” comments a senior Labour frontbencher. Not just one, but two, damning investigations found against him. The first finding, produced some weeks ago by the Commons select committee which covers the media, concluded that he made “significant errors of judgment” when he failed to reveal that he had helped to facilitate a secret personal loan for Boris Johnson when he was still at Number 10. That made a mockery of the appointments process because it denied vital information to those scrutinising it. The second report, by Adam Heppinstall KC for the public appointments commissioner, was unequivocal that he unambiguously breached the governance code. , Its judgments are often inaccurate and outdated and they put undue stress on heads and teachers. We need a more intelligent approach to inspectionsChoosing your child’s school can feel like immensely high stakes. They will spend years living and breathing that choice, and it will almost inevitably be where their younger siblings go. So it was sighs of relief all round this month when my niece got into her first-choice primary, a lovely school where she attends nursery, and the only one that’s a walk away. How to pick a school isn’t always obvious. Distance is a factor; parents often visit to get a feel; and there is a range of public information, from Ofsted inspection reports to pupil attainment data. Is it better to go for a school rated “good” by Ofsted that you can walk to, or is an “outstanding” school worth the daily drive or bus? What happens if the head leaves an outstanding school a year or two in, given the difficulties in recruiting a new one because of the risk it might be downgraded next time? , Oliver Dowden’s appointment as deputy PM proves that the Conservatives’ shallow well of talent is as rancid as our waterways All across the land the emergency alarm went off. Oliver Dowden had been appointed deputy prime minister. The harsh metallic tone of the mobile phone sounded suspiciously like the rattle of a barrel being scraped bare. Metal on metal. There’s not an ounce of talent left in the Tory party. If it was a circus elephant you’d put a bullet in its head and have done with it. A kindness. Dominic Skeletor Raab is gone, currently preparing to spend more time with the sentient throbbing vein in his head that tells him who can live and who must die. The Conservative response to Raab’s transgressions is not to make sure ministers stop bullying civil service staff, but instead to recruit only party loyalists who will be grateful for the honour of being shouted at by a top Tory, rather than kicking up a fuss. Those wet wipes! Those silly bitches! , The home secretary is emboldening the far right by pointing the finger at ethnic groupsIn a recent Spectator column, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, claimed that by highlighting the Pakistani ethnicity of grooming gang members in a “string of cases”, she was merely pointing out “unfashionable facts”. Yet why zero in on a string of cases that received extensive media coverage, rather than acknowledging the full scale of the problem based on the data we have about all such cases? To learn that half a million British children are sexually abused each year should drive us to anger and action. We are right to want to know how to tackle a problem taking place on such a vast national scale. But we cannot tackle a problem if we fail to truly see what that problem is. And that means seeing it through the lens of fact. , There’s more to celebrate than coupling and procreating, a C of E report has admittedRejoice, ye singleton, for this week, thou art truly blessed. On Wednesday, the Church of England released the findings of its report on families and households and one of the key messages, endorsed by the archbishops of Canterbury and York, is that it’s about time we honoured the state of singleness. The commission, which has consulted over the past two years, “believes strongly that single people must be valued at the heart of our society” and wants the church to celebrate them. , Polling reveals most voters can now see through the referendum’s lies much more clearly than their leaders  ‘Half a league, half a league, / Half a league onward. / All in the valley of Death, / Rode the six hundred.” Why does Tennyson’s great poem come to mind as the local garage waits for a spare part to be delivered from Turin to fix a problem with my Fiat? In pre-Brexit days, thanks to Margaret Thatcher’s great achievement in integrating the British economy into the European single market, spare parts for cars, dishwashers – you name it – could be delivered almost overnight thanks to the sophistication of the EU supply chain. , One writer describes the shock of seeing the streets where she lives peppered with bullets That morning when the fighting started will remain with me for ever. It started normally enough: I planned to break the Ramadan fast with a group of journalists in downtown Khartoum, preparing myself to go out for an appointment with a musician in our home in Omdurman, the city on the other side of the Nile from Khartoum. Then, around 9am, I saw messages from colleagues about sounds of gunfire coming from south Khartoum, so I thought I would go and see what was going on. Soon I was hearing about fighting between the Rapid Support Forces and the army around the airport, the presidential palace, and the military headquarters. I know all of these locations very well, and most of them are very close to the neighbourhood where all the newspapers are based and where I often work. Now they were a war zone. , It’s time for baby boomers to share their spoils with the young, or else trouble lies aheadThe promise that living in an affluent society with a healthy economy holds out is that successive generations will enjoy ever-greater opportunities. But in the UK that intergenerational covenant is under threat, thanks to a housing market that means falling numbers of people will own their own home, and an ageing society in which today’s young people will shoulder the burden of higher taxes to meet the health and care costs of their parents’ generation. Sir Keir Starmer is right to focus on this as one of the most important issues a Labour government must address in his interview with the Observer today. So many factors are against today’s young people. First, there are the inherently difficult economics of an ageing society, the product of falling birthrates. Britain will need to spend a higher proportion of GDP on healthcare and pensions as our population of older people increases, with fewer working-age taxpayers to shoulder these costs. And people in their 20s and 30s will not have the same private pension provision as this generation of retired workers, many of whom have benefited from generous defined-benefit schemes long since closed to younger workers. , A public figure should know better than to deny the existence of anti-Jewish racismDiane Abbott denies that Travellers, Irish and Jewish people ever, at any point in their lives and at any point in history, experience racism (“Racism is black and white”, Letters). She justifies this by observing that “Jewish people… were not required to sit at the back of the bus”. Maybe not, but Jewish people were rounded up on to trains and transported to death camps – to say nothing of the pubs and hotels whose signs used to read: “No Jews, no Blacks, no Irish.” I would be delighted to invite Ms Abbott to my synagogue, where she can meet the security volunteers who keep us safe from antisemitic attacks, and watch us reading from a Torah scroll saved from destruction during the Holocaust. Perhaps, then, she will understand how inappropriate it is for a public figure to make extraordinary and inflammatory remarks such as denying the existence of anti-Jewish racism.Rabbi Gabriel Kanter-WebberBrighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue , A moment of weakness on TV has done nothing for the president’s strongman image in a country already tiring of authoritarian ruleTurkey’s strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is looking a little weaker this weekend after dramatically falling ill on live television during campaigning for 14 May presidential and parliamentary elections. Erdoğan, 69, has ruthlessly wielded power, as prime minister and president, for 20 years. His carefully cultivated image is of a tough, indestructible leader. Yet suddenly he appears frail. Ministers insist that his illness – he has previously had intestinal surgery – is nothing more serious than stomach flu. He rejoined the fray on Saturday. , Shadow secretary for culture calls for root and branch review of top appointments Ministers are facing fresh demands to bolster the independence of the process to find the next BBC chair after claims that “cronyism and sleaze” have damaged the role and the corporation’s reputation. The government has been pressed to depoliticise the appointment of the job after the resignation of Richard Sharp, a Tory donor. He quit after an independent investigation found he had failed to reveal critical information about his role in facilitating a loan for then prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job. , Government to extend powers to target fakes and fraudsters  Cold calls offering financial products will be banned as part of a government crackdown on fraud following evidence that millions of people are being targeted each week. Once the ban is in force, anyone being offered phoney cryptocurrency schemes or fraudulent insurance can assume they are a scam. , Musk calls the one-click move a win for both the public and media organisations Twitter CEO Elon Musk said on Saturday that the social media platform will allow media publishers to charge users on a per-article basis with one click, calling it a win for both the public and media organisations. The feature, to be rolled out in May, will enable users who do not “sign up for a monthly subscription to pay a higher per article price for when they want to read an occasional article”, billionaire owner Musk tweeted. , Brenton Craig Abbas Abdullah McArthur faces up to 14 months in prison if convicted  Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast An Australian man is facing more than a year in jail after allegedly spitting in the face of an imam at an Indonesian mosque.

In 2016 she was Bafta-nominated for The Diary of a Teenage Girl and shortlisted for a British independent film award for playing Princess Margaret in A Royal Night Out. Subsequent film roles include The King of Staten Island and Mary Shelley, where she met her fiance, actor Douglas Booth. On TV, she’s starred in The Morning Show and Dolly Alderton’s Everything I Know About Love. She now plays Hermine “Miep” Gies in miniseries A Small Light, based on the true story of the young woman who hid the Frank family during the second world war and preserved Anne’s diary. Were you familiar with Miep Gies’s story?I’d read Anne Frank’s diary as a kid, and I’m Jewish myself, so you grow up with this weight of history running through your family, but I knew nothing about Miep Gies. I was offered the role on Holocaust Memorial Day, which felt kind of special, but was genuinely like: Who is that? Nor did I know about the occupation of the Netherlands and the Dutch resistance. The first thing I did was get my butt over to Amsterdam. It’s a city that operates in a very specific way – everyone cycles everywhere, it’s built on waterways – so I immersed myself in how it feels to live there. I visited the Anne Frank museum, obviously, but also went to Miep’s old apartment and cycled the same routes as her. That was my springboard for working on this. , It’s late and over budget but the Museum of Natural History’s $465m gallery gives a stunning home to its insects Some museums have more personality than others and the American Museum of Natural History has never had trouble attracting attention. Packed with rare specimens, organic samples and glittering minerals, as well as some uncannily lifelike animal and human models, the New York institution has long featured in urban legend, as well as on the big screen. So this week – despite the fact that the Metropolitan Museum, its larger, arty sister directly across Central Park, is to hold its glitzy annual gala on Monday – the AMNH will still be competing for headlines. After nine years of planning, a pandemic and $465m (£370m) spent, the museum opens an audacious new building on Thursday – the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation. , Lisa Cortés’s richly enjoyable film examines the alter egos and queer theories surrounding a conflicted star who was way ahead of his time If Little Richard AKA Richard Wayne Penniman, was criminally underrated for much of his career, his legacy has burned bright since his death in May 2020. Last weekend, the BBC debuted James House’s Little Richard: King and Queen of Rock ’n’ Roll, a solid, feature-length UK/US co-production that’s now on iPlayer. Meanwhile, the Dee Rees exec-produced Little Richard: I Am Everything, which premiered at Sundance back in January, is in UK cinemas. Unsurprisingly, there’s significant crossover between the docs in terms of archive footage and interviewees (Nile Rogers tells pretty much the same story in both – about David Bowie wanting to sound the way Little Richard looked). But the films also have distinctly different approaches, with director Lisa Cortés leaning further into the queer-theory aspects of Penniman’s ever-changing alter egos. , As his second novel is published, the award-winning writer talks about being doubted as a teenager, the courage of his migrating ancestors, and how he uses his photography to spark stories Chaotic conditions in Peckham: brolly-ruining wind, sudden showers, one of those afternoons when the weather apps show every symbol from sunshine to lightning and leave you to figure it out. Caleb Azumah Nelson, the 29-year-old author and artist whose prose and photographs tend to document life in south London, was meant to be showing me around today. We might have swung by the Peckhamplex cinema, the public library off Rye Lane, maybe getting as far as Morley’s burger bar to the south or Bagel King further north – all of which places Nelson has written about in his beautiful second novel, Small Worlds, a follow-up to 2021’s Open Water, which won the Costa first novel award. Instead of roaming, as planned, we’re taking shelter from heavy rain under an awning outside Peckham Rye station. Nelson recently spent eight weeks on a writers’ retreat in north-east America. “There was a polar vortex or something,” he says. “It was minus 40. Balaclava weather. My eyelashes actually froze together.” Today’s grey city rain is no great hardship by comparison. We set out to find a cafe he likes on Rye Lane, fighting with our umbrellas all the way. , High-octane spy thriller Citadel knows how to have a good time; Malpractice plays as a medical Line of Duty; Big Mick and co return in comedy gold The Curse; and Arena tries to get behind the sunglasses of Karl Lagerfeld Citadel (Amazon Prime Video)Malpractice (ITVX) | itv.comThe Curse (Channel 4) | channel4.comThe Mysterious Mr Lagerfeld (BBC Two) | iPlayer A hurtling train. The black outline of a man falling through fiery, Lucozade-hued water. An elite collective (Manticore) vowing to bring down Citadel, a network of secret agents devoted to global “safety and security”. It must be a new spy thriller series. And going by the first two episodes of David Weil’s six-part Citadel on Amazon Prime Video, an old-school (red-blooded, sexy) one at that. , The great chronicler of Ukraine breaks new ground in his rigorous and elegant analysis of Europe’s biggest conflict since 1945 – and its impact on friends and family On 23 February 2022, Serhii Plokhy was in Vienna on sabbatical from his teaching job at Harvard. He went to bed hoping the disturbing news on CNN was somehow wrong. Like many others, including his country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian historian was reluctant to believe Russia was about to launch a full-scale assault on his homeland. The omens suggested otherwise. That autumn, Vladimir Putin had massed tanks and battalions close to Ukraine’s borders. And yet it was hard to believe this portended a brazen imperial expedition by one state against another, and the biggest war in Europe since 1945. “I believed the troop movement was part of Russian blackmail,” Plokhy writes. , The beauty industry’s most prestigious makeup artists are ready to give you a helping hand… here’s howApplying makeup professionally requires great products and also great skill, hence most of us simply do what we do and hope for the best.

In the nearly five years I’ve been writing this column, I’ve sometimes been accused of making up the more alarming things that have happened to me. This is not the case, as many of my more incident-free columns should sadly prove. ‘Please,’ I say to family and friends, damning myself with every word, ‘if I made stuff up, my column would be a lot more exciting.’ It’s just that when something unlikely or horrifying does happen to me, I jump at it with both hands. The sad, obvious truth about parenting is that much of it is very boring. The sad, obvious truth about writing about parenting is that ‘much of it is very boring’ will not suffice. Knowing this cannot remedy the fact that there are simply weeks in which nothing of any interest happens to me at all, and I’m forced to tackle things from whatever angle I can. This was a problem when I had one child, who often did very little or, worse, did nothing but the one thing I’d already written an article about some weeks previously. I’ve so far avoided writing a column entitled: ‘Yet more adventures in potty training’, but I could have done for most of 2022. And now I have a daughter, I find she alternates between doing very little and doing things that her brother has already done. All of which means, to paraphrase Vivian Mercier’s famous review of Waiting for Godot, ‘Not only does nothing happen, nothing happens twice.’ , There are no ‘nul points’ in this super selectionLike many people, I grew up watching Eurovision. So it was a real thrill to put together a mini Eurovision box, with five full-size bars, £34.95 (10% discount for readers with EUROAB10, valid until end of June) representing six nations (one bar represents two countries). The dual bar is Puchero’s Churros bar, a 38% milk with real churros crushed into it. It’s the sort of bar you’d eat at a midnight feast and not regret a bit of, and perfect for munching while watching Eurovision 2023. The bar is made in Spain, but one of the makers is Italian. It is addictive, so be careful. Table’s 61% Haitian milk is made in Liverpool, which is entirely fitting given it is the host city. It is so creamy it’ll remind you of childhood chocolate (which we know didn’t really taste like that but memories do become more golden with time). , Celebrate the Coronation and raise a glass with some premium home-grown bubblesChapel Down Sparkling Brut, England NV (£21.99, Waitrose) Amid all the pomp and circumstance of next weekend’s festivities, it’s easy to see why the English wine business spies a good opportunity. It’s all part of English wine’s remarkable progress over the past couple of decades, a period in which it has gone from a largely amateurish pursuit to become, to use the UK government’s ludicrously boosterish parlance honestly for once, a ‘world-beating’ industry. Certainly, the Coronation, like last year’s Platinum Jubilee, will have its share of commemorative bottlings by English sparkling producers and it seems likely that many punters will, as they did last June, take the patriotic option as their sparkling choice at parties and gatherings. Among the producers making a special cuvée for King Charles is one of the biggest, Chapel Down, which has released a 2,000-bottle run of Coronation Edition from the 2016 vintage at £65 a pop. I’ve not tried it, but the company’s regular, widely available Brut NV is among the most consistently enjoyable English sparkling wines around. Leckford Sparkling Brut, England NV (£24.99, Waitrose) One measure of English fizz’s progress is the confidence its leading producers now have in selling at prices akin to top champagne. Chapel Down’s Kit’s Coty Coeur de Cuvée 2016 goes for £120 a bottle, while Gusbourne’s 51° North 2014 costs £195. English sparkling wine has been adopted by the supermarkets, all of which now have an own-label or two of the style on their shelves. Waitrose has taken the idea even further, having planted a small vineyard at the company’s farm, Leckford Estate, in Hampshire, in 2009. The sparkling brut, which is made from Leckford’s pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay grapes by the well-established Ridgeview Estate in East Sussex, is very good indeed, with a mix of typically nervy English Cox’s apple acidity and buttered toasty notes. , The garden beds and house are filled with yellows and blues, the first of spring’s many flowers Spring at the summerhouse. The meadow is alive with primroses. Runs of soft-coloured flowers, nestling in corners, carpeted under trees. Many more than ever before. Sharp celandines, too, a brighter, braver yellow. Scattered through the banks, dotted through the grass. Nodding violets in white, and deep purple, shelter in the hedges, spray out under low-hanging branches. A perfect perfume. , The country has recorded its hottest, driest April yet. For people working outdoors, it’s no joke There are many better places to be in Spain than Madrid when recordbreaking temperatures bring summer’s ruthless heat in spring, prompting government health warnings, action plans from regional authorities and the familiar agonising wait for outdoor public pools to open. There are also many better places to be in Madrid when the mercury nudges 30C (86F) than under a woolly hat inside a furry Sonic the Hedgehog costume in the elegant, shadeless air fryer that is the Spanish capital’s Plaza Mayor. , As 2024 election season gets under way the network must figure out how to keep its audience – and its advertisers – happy In less than a week, Fox News has agreed to pay out $787.5m in a huge legal settlement and fired its most popular host, in an unprecedented crisis for America’s most-watched cable news channel just as a critical presidential election cycle begins. With the 2024 election essentially already under way, rightwing Fox News must now wrestle – quickly – with how to hold on to the audience that Tucker Carlson, the incendiary rightwing extremist who was fired on Monday, captured and cultivated during his murky seven-year tenure as a primetime host. , Democrats center abortion rights in early stages of presidential campaign while Republicans waver over unpopular position Hours after Joe Biden announced his re-election campaign on Tuesday, his vice-president and 2024 running mate, Kamala Harris, delivered a fiery call to action for voters alarmed by the loss of constitutional protections for abortion. “This is a moment for us to stand and fight,” she said to a packed auditorium at Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington and her alma mater. To the “extremist so-called leaders” rolling back access to reproductive rights, Harris warned: “Don’t get in our way because if you do, we’re going to stand up, we’re going to organize and we’re going to speak up.” , Permissive self-defense and gun laws spotlighted by recent shootings in which victims approached gunmen by mistake Waldes Thomas and Diamond Darville were driving for the grocery delivery service Instacart near Miami in mid-April when they drove the order up to the wrong address. Thomas, 19, and Darville, 18, reportedly told authorities they were backing away from the home when the owner emerged with his son, grabbed on to the driver’s window and fired a gun three times at their car. Antonio Caccavale, who didn’t hit anyone, later reportedly claimed to police who investigated the encounter that he shot because he feared for his and his son’s lives as Thomas and Darville’s car ran over his foot and struck a boulder. , In a time before luxury flats and Google offices, the docklands of the Liffey were ruled by tykes on bikes In 1985, Syd Shelton recalls, children on bikes still ruled the streets; there weren’t so many cars, and kids didn’t have phones to stare at. He took this picture in Dublin, near the docks. He was in the city preparing a photographic project called Ireland: A Week in the Life of a Nation. Fifty photographers, some famous, such as William Klein, were due to arrive to capture the country in pictures. In the meantime, Shelton had some time to wander. He thinks of this picture as a street portrait rather than something entirely spontaneous: “I was using flash and a tripod and the image was very much a conversation between me and the kids.” The street with the gasometers was in Ringsend, on the south bank of the Liffey. At the time it was entirely a residential area – some of the houses were built by William Beckett, Samuel’s grandfather, in the 1880s. Many of them have now been demolished. Ringsend is the home of Google’s European HQ, and the gasometer has been redeveloped as luxury apartments. Shelton has another photograph from that afternoon in 1985. “I got the kids on bikes to gather their mates,” he says, “and I took a picture of 40 of them, with the gasometer behind.” Seen Not Heard is at Atlas Gallery, London W1, 19 May-24 June , Om Dhungel escaped ethnic persecution in Bhutan to make a new life in Australia. The strength and potential of refugees like him, he says, is vastly underestimated  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email In his first weeks in Australia on a student visa, Om Dhungel wanted to get a job to send money to his family in Nepal, all refugees driven out of Bhutan. But people here struggled to understand his accent. Sometimes, they would mistakenly call him Tom. Soon after arriving in Sydney, he spotted a vacancy sign on the street, and excitedly pulled his borrowed car in to apply for a position – but it was a motel sign, not a workplace. “I laugh at it now, but I actually cried after that,” chuckles the slim, moustachioed and bespectacled 61-year-old, almost 25 years later. ]   \n",

Wednesday Ukraine has formed eight new “storm” brigades to take part in a future counteroffensive amid growing speculation about its timing and whether it can inflict serious defeats on Russia. The Ukrainian interior ministry said it had “fully formed” initial brigades comprising up to 40,000 troops, but they would need further training before being ready to fight. An explosion derailed a freight train for the second day in a row in a Russian region bordering Ukraine on Tuesday, sending both the locomotive and some cars off the tracks, authorities said. It occurred in the western Bryansk region, which borders both Ukraine and Belarus. Russian officials say pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups have made multiple attacks there since 2022. The US plans to announce as soon as Wednesday a new $300m military aid package for Ukraine that will for the first time include a short-range air-launched rocket, two US officials have said. The rockets could help Ukraine weaken Russian ground positions and provide advancing Ukrainian ground forces with air support for a spring offensive. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said his country was inflicting heavy blows to Ukraine across the entire frontline but the supply of weapons was crucial to success. In a meeting with Moscow’s top military officials, Shoigu said Russian combat operations were engaged “along the entire line of contact”, fighting Ukraine and its “unprecedented military assistance from the west”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said German-supplied weapons were already being used in the Donbas region, which Russia has illegally annexed. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Monday that Germany had insisted, like other Nato member countries, that the weapons it was supplying to Ukraine must not be used against Russian territory. The Donbas is not Russian territory. Ukraine’s military vowed on Tuesday not to give up the eastern city of Bakhmut as it prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russian forces. General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, underlined the importance Kyiv attaches to holding Bakhmut as preparations continue for a counterattack that it hopes will change the dynamic of the war. Russia’s military has sustained 100,000 deaths and injuries in the past five months in fighting against Ukraine, mostly in the Bakhmut region, the White House has estimated. The national security spokesperson John Kirby said the figure, based on US intelligence estimates, included more than 20,000 dead. The Kremlin rejected the US assessment of Russian military casualties in Ukraine as having been “plucked from thin air” and said Washington had no way of obtaining the correct data. Turkey’s trade data has started to reflect that Ankara has stopped allowing the re-exportation of sanctioned western goods to Russia after repeated warnings from Washington, a senior US treasury official has told reporters. All parties in the Black Sea grain initiative will meet for talks on Wednesday, according to a senior Ukrainian source. Additionally, the senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan is expected to travel to Moscow this week. At least six Russian regions have scrapped 9 May Victory Day parades to mark the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany amid fear of Ukrainian attacks. The governor of Saratov, 400 miles from the border, announced that its parade was off because of “safety concerns”. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that three apartment buildings and a school were damaged in Kramatorsk in a strike by Russian S-300 missiles that caused one injury. , British Museum, LondonCenturies of conflict between the civilisations of Persia and Greece are chiefly captured through elaborate drinking vessels in this lively – and occasionally puzzling – show A pair of sculpted heads stare at each other at the start of this exhibition: an ancient Persian with a square beard and tight ringlets facing up to the Greek god Apollo. Here is a polarity that has defined global history. The struggle between the Greek city states and the Achaemenid empire was believed by the Greeks to be a fight to establish who they were: western, not eastern, self-governing, and democratic in the case of Athens, as opposed to the playthings of Persian tyrants. But guess what – the reality was more complicated. The Persian portrait and the Chatsworth Apollo, as it’s known, are not so different. Both come from 5th century BC Cyprus, and are associated with sanctuaries where Apollo and the Persian god Reshef were jointly worshipped. , Lampard has lost six in a row but this team is the result of a bad plan, enacted badly, by people who are bad at enacting plans It lives. It breathes. Those drooping limbs have bloomed with new life. There will be time, also, for the most startling aspect of this late season knockabout at the Emirates, the strange, zombified spectacle currently operating as Chelsea Football Club. Before that the headlines will rightly be about Arsenal, on a night when their own apparently doomed title push thrust a fist up through the turf and dragged itself back up on to its it feet. A 3-1 win means that Arsenal are now two points clear at the top of the league, albeit having played two matches more than a Manchester City team that seems to win games these days simply by turning up and pointing itself vaguely in the right direction. Arsenal were peppy and busy and full of clever angles for as long as it was necessary to be any of those things, which wasn’t very long at all. , Investments in Bristol and Santo Tomas in the Philippines will be worth £100m and £166m respectively Dyson has revealed plans to build a new battery factory in Singapore, alongside investments by the maker of vacuum cleaners and dryers in technology centres in the UK and the Philippines.

About one in every five women develops a mental illness at some point during the perinatal period, the stage from pregnancy up to a year after giving birth. However, none of the health and social care boards in Northern Ireland or Wales met the national quality standards created by the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Perinatal Quality Network (PQN). , Nuria Piera, known for her investigations into corruption, was targeted three times, Amnesty International says One of the Dominican Republic’s most prominent investigative journalists was targeted using spyware made by NSO Group, according to a new report released by Amnesty International. Nuria Piera, who is well known for her investigations into corruption, was hacked three times between 2020 and 2021, according to Amnesty’s forensic analysis of her mobile phone. The revelation marks the first confirmation that NSO’s military-grade spyware, Pegasus, has been used to target journalists in the Dominican Republic, making it the third Latin American country – after Mexico and El Salvador – where such abuse has been discovered. ,  Jordi Alba scores winner against Osasuna in 85th minute Real Madrid lose; RB Leipzig hammer Freiburg 5-1 in Cup Barcelona are just one win away from winning La Liga after their 1-0 victory over Osasuna was followed by Real Madrid losing 2-0 away to Real Socieded.

Democrats had convened a hearing of the Senate judiciary committee after a series of media reports on entanglements between two of the court’s conservative justices and parties with interests in its cases. These includes Clarence Thomas’s acceptance of luxury travel and a real estate deal from Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow, and Neil Gorsuch’s sale of a property to a law firm executive with business before the court. Both were interactions the two justices did not fully disclose. , Seven others taken to hospital with stab wounds after serious altercation in the early hours of Sunday morning A man has been charged with the murder of a 32-year-old man in an incident near a nightclub in Cornwall where several people sustained stab injuries, police said.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday night said it plans to abolish the stricter “premium” class of London stock market listing, and make it easier for company founders to keep control of businesses using US-style “golden shares”, among a series of big changes to City regulations. , New fraud strategy responding to web- and phone-based scams will result in recruitment of 400 new ‘specialist investigators’ Ministers have announced a clampdown on the use of cold calls to sell financial products and on technology which allows mass texting of numerous phones as part of a strategy to combat fraud, now the UK’s most common crime. The new fraud strategy, a response to the massive growth of web- and phone-based scams, will alsoresult in what was billed as 400 new specialist investigators across police and the National Crime Agency recruited as part of a revamp for how the the crime is investigated. , Number of companies listed on main market in London has fallen by 40% since 2008 Does the UK stock market need the biggest shake-up since the 1980s of the rules that apply to listed companies? Well, it’s hard to deny that something has gone wrong – and was going wrong before the Japanese owner of Arm Holdings delivered the latest snub by opting to list the Cambridge-based chip-maker, the UK’s tech champion, in New York. The number of companies with a listing on the main market in London has fallen by 40% since 2008. Meanwhile, UK pension funds and insurance companies have scarpered to the perceived safety of bonds. They owned 52% of the market in 1990; now just 4%. The buzz ain’t what it used to be. And, since a dynamic stock market tends to go hand in hand with wider economic health, decline matters. , “It’s not over,” Mikel Arteta had said on Monday. It feels as if it is, Manchester City just too powerful, as evidenced by their 4-1 dismissal of Arsenal last Wednesday. But Arsenal cannot allow their Premier League title push to fizzle out. They owe it to themselves after the excellent season they have produced. Arteta’s men kept up their side of the bargain, moving back to the top of the table, two points clear of City, having played two matches more, although to have failed to beat this Chelsea team would have been an abdication. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts 3 min: Saka and White combine briskly down the right, the latter crossing deep.

Leto’s look comfortably overshadowed acres of pearl-encrusted gowns at the Met’s annual fundraiser. The theme was late designer Karl Lagerfeld; Leto came as Choupette, the pet he reportedly left £1.3m ($1.6m) in his will and scored a major publicity land grab. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts The teams are out! Arsenal in their famous red with white sleeves, Chelsea their equally storied blue. (Of course, it could be Chelsea sporting white sleeves, as the novel idea was first proposed to their manager David Calderhead by Daily Mail cartoonist Tom Webster in the 1930s. But the conservative-with-small-c Calderhead didn’t fancy making the change, and it was Arsenal’s Herbert Chapman who ran with it instead.) Anyway, there’s a rare old derby noise at the Emirates, and we’ll be off in a couple of shakes. The pre-match predictions are in, and as Tarby would say on Winner Takes All, we have a difference of opinion. “Predicting that Chelsea come out and play a blinder: why do so many teams appear to be ‘up for it’ against the Arsenal?” – Bill Hargreaves , The civil service is ‘a team without a captain’, argues Anthony Seldon. But can Sunak stomach ousting Case before the election? Senior civil servants have been asking whether Simon Case can survive at the top of Whitehall for almost as long as he has been in post. From his oversight of No 10 during the Partygate scandal to his role in the Richard Sharp affair, Case’s name has cropped up in almost every controversy to dog Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak over the last two years. When a top official repeatedly becomes the story, more often than not that means their days in the job are numbered. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts Frank Lampard talks to Sky. “We’re coming to a really good team … it’s going to be tough for us … the challenge might not be a bad thing for us, because the players have to react … we have to show what we can do … individually we know there is a lot of talent in the squad but the nature of being a team against what has become a team with a real identity here is a challenge for us … [Aubameyang] has a history of scoring goals and maybe a motivation to play here … Noni has trained really well, and when you come in with a big squad you need players who show something in training and he’s shown that … it’s a big job, it’s a challenge, as a club we’ve been really successful for a long time and this is a year of transition on many levels … that can bring obvious difficulties but also excuses and we have to put those to bed … you don’t succeed unless you have togetherness, standards, spirit, and maybe that’s been affected this year … so it’s difficult to put a time frame on it … it may take time … it has to be a collective … Arsenal are a good reference point … we’ve got a hard run-in but the players have a lot to play for … I see a team low on confidence … but the natural talent is there … this league is unforgiving … I’m very positive about the squad but the players need to work and work hard.” Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports, considers the six-day break Arsenal have enjoyed since the City defeat. “It was necessary to reset, recharge the batteries and bring some clarity again, and focus on the big game tonight … we conceded too many goals, we had to shake it up, to give people opportunities they deserve … there are players who deserve to play minutes … they have a lot of players who are great on the break and we need some control of the game … City were exceptional on the day and reached a level we could not reach, I cannot fault the players … we didn’t win enough duels the other day … there are a lot of things we have to do much better today … we must play really well tonight, be us … and if we win this game we are top of the league again with four games to go.” , Home Office claims timing of new powers, taking effect days before king’s coronation, is coincidental Official warning letters have been sent to anti-monarchists planning peaceful protests at King Charles III’s coronation saying that new criminal offences to prevent disruption have been rushed into law. Using tactics described by lawyers as “intimidatory”, the Home Office’s Police Powers Unit wrote to the campaign group Republic saying new powers had been brought forward to prevent “disruption at major sporting and cultural events”. Protesters who block roads, airports and railways could face 12 months behind bars. Anyone locking on to others, objects or buildings could go to prison for six months and face an unlimited fine. Police will be able to head off disruption by stopping and searching protesters if they suspect they are setting out to cause chaos. , Cabinet Office says investigation paused until after watchdog decides whether to delay start of job with Keir Starmer • UK politics live –latest news updates The government has paused an internal inquiry into Sue Gray’s departure from Whitehall which was widely expected to have concluded that she had broken the civil service code. In a written statement, the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said the former senior official had not engaged with the investigation into her departure so it would be suspended while the government considered “next steps”. , Woman accused of murdering seven babies cries as she tells court she never harmed a child in her care Lucy Letby wept as she told a court her “whole world was stopped” when she was accused of the “sickening” murders of multiple babies in a hospital neo-natal unit.

Alfie Steele had 50 injuries on his body when he was found lifeless in a bath at home in Droitwich on 18 February 2021, and was later pronounced dead at Worcester Royal hospital. , Naturalist is suing three men over claims he fraudulently solicited donations for tiger charity Claims that Chris Packham fraudulently solicited donations for a charity that rescued tigers are among an “enormous amount of puerile, offensive and damaging material” published about him, the high court has heard. The prominent naturalist has alleged that Dominic Wightman, the editor of the online site Country Squire Magazine, as well as the writer Nigel Bean and a third man, Paul Read, libelled him in nine articles that referred to his involvement with the Wildheart Trust, which runs a wildlife sanctuary on the Isle of Wight. , Lisa Birnbach testifies that Carroll called her and described the incident in 1996, and that she told her friend ‘E Jean, he raped you’ A close friend of E Jean Carroll has told a New York jury that she received a distressed call from the advice columnist within minutes of Donald Trump allegedly raping her. Lisa Birnbach testified at Carroll’s civil action against the former president on Tuesday that she was feeding her children at home when Carroll called “breathless, hyperventilating, emotional” in the spring of 1996.

The websites churn out content relating to politics, health, environment, finance and technology at a “high volume”, the researchers found, to provide rapid turnover of material to saturate with adverts for profit. , Move to recruit up to 40,000 troops aimed at inflicting heavy losses on Russia in Bakhmut area  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates Eight new Ukrainian brigades of soldiers have been formed to take part in a future counteroffensive amid growing speculation about its timing and whether it can succeed in inflicting a serious defeat on the Russian invaders. The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Tuesday it had “fully formed” the initial “storm” brigades, comprising up to 40,000 troops, but added they would need further training before being ready to take part in fighting. , Governor of region 400 miles from border latest to cancel over ‘safety concerns’ in glaring admission of vulnerability At least six Russian regions have scrapped 9 May Victory Day parades that mark the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany amid fears over Ukrainian strikes, with a region 400 miles from the border being the latest to cancel. The governor of Saratov announced the parade there would not go ahead because of “safety concerns”, adding to a string of cancellations that are a glaring admission of the country’s military vulnerability more than 14 months into the war. , US estimates 20,000 Russian soldiers have died in five months; Black Sea grain initiative talks scheduled for Wednesday , Taken from a new book about the women of the Factory Records label, the New Order keyboardist remembers her daunting start with the band – and their nights out to fetish clubs Gillian Gilbert’s story as a musician – along with the numerous unseen women who worked for Factory Records – started well before the label became a sensation in 1983 with New Order’s Blue Monday. Gillian learned guitar and keys, occasionally played on stage with Joy Division, and later became a member of New Order – joining Stephen Morris, Bernard Sumner, and Peter Hook – following the tragic death of Ian Curtis in 1980. I got to know everybody [in New Order] and the manager, Rob [Gretton]. It was the manager who suggested, when Ian died, to bring another singer in, which they didn’t want to do. Eventually he said: “Why don’t you just bring somebody in that nobody thought would be brought in?” , Labour leader says they will be both going and staying – and he can’t say fairer or unfairer than that When you’re 15 points ahead in the polls with the local elections just two days away, some might argue that it is best to keep quiet. Especially if you haven’t really got much new to say. Why rock the boat when you’ve got a comfortable lead? No need to go for another goal when you’re five-nil up with only added time to play. Just keep it safe, bank the win and save your resources for more important games to come. Don’t give the Tory party chair, Greg Hands, an excuse to fire off another desperate tweet about Labour having spent all the money. Keir Starmer saw it rather differently. He had chosen to do a morning tour of the BBC studios. A last-chance power drive to remind everyone of what was at stake this week. Only he didn’t really appear to have given it much thought, as his only consistent message was that everyone was more broke than they had ever been. Almost as though he had imagined that just saying the same thing over and over again would get him through any 15-minute interview. , When Charles was crowned Prince of Wales, he didn’t know he was wearing a table tennis ball on his head. What can the world expect on Saturday? We examine the strange and often blood-drenched world of crown design When King Charles was invested as the Prince of Wales in 1969, the young royal went through all the pomp and ceremony unaware that the jazzy modern crown he wore on his head was topped with a ping-pong ball. The plastic sphere was, of course, well disguised: not only coated with gold filigree but also surrounded by a floating constellation of diamonds arranged in the shape of Charles’s star sign, Scorpio. It was pagan astrology meets high church meets high camp, a fittingly fruity headpiece for the eccentric prince. The crown was designed by Louis Osman, an architect and goldsmith described by one of his friends as “the original hippie” – and it marked a radical departure from the usual staid royal headwear. This was a futuristic vision featuring swooping golden arches surrounded by abstract fleurs-de-lis and needle-thin crosses that jutted out like splintering lightning bolts. The gold, symbolically, came from a Welsh nugget, but rather than being traditionally hammered it was – in a showcase of modern methods – electroplated on to an epoxy resin cast. An internal purple velvet cap banded with ermine completed the look, fulfilling Charles’s wish for a crown that could be worn by a “modern prince” with a regular haircut, not someone with a wig, and “ears that show”. , Amid cost of living crisis and reneged promises, Thursday’s outcome could swing on more local concerns On a typically grey day in Greater Manchester, the diggers are rumbling along the roads outside Bolton market. Half a decade since the last departure from the old Moor Road bus station, the council’s “masterplan” for redevelopment is still a work in progress. “It’s a big disappointment,” says Phyllis Waits, stopping with her husband, John, to buy fish in the market. “Bolton used to be thriving. It’s a Friday morning – it should be absolutely buzzing, but there are only a handful of shops left. Everywhere has closed.” , Annie O’Neill, who visits 33 schools a term, has noticed a huge rise in problems such as eating disorders  Calls for 11,000 more school nurses in UK Annie O’Neill has just finished delivering a session in which she has taught year 13 students to manage their anxious “glitter mind” with breathing exercises, CBT techniques and mindfulness. When the school nurse finishes, one of the students shyly shuffles up. After a long pause, she says: “I have a lot of pressure on me. All the time I have a voice in my head saying I’m not good enough.” The student is a high achiever with an offer at a top university and a supportive family, yet she cannot shake the feeling that although she spends so much time revising, nothing is going in. She has not spoken to anyone else about how overwhelmed she is feeling. , Armed robberies rise across Sudan capital as fighting causes breakdown in law and order Wearing loose clothes with guns in their pockets, a group of seven young men gather every night with a tray of tea on the terrace of one of their houses to guard their east Khartoum neighbourhood. A breakdown in law and order in the capital amid fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and an availability of guns in part driven by those that can be taken from the bodies of dead soldiers, has led to an increase in armed robberies. All prisoners in the capital – including convicted murderers – have been released or escaped from prisons and, in the absence of police, groups of civilians banding together to protect themselves. , There’s a little bit of popstar aiming for No 1 – and fans will enjoy lots of behind-the-scenes footage – but Sheeran appears as a homely, nice man struggling with difficult circumstances Cheekier viewers than me might wonder how this Disney+ documentary is going to manage to fill out an entire four-part series about the singer. Sheeran is massive, the biggest male pop star in the world, capable of selling out – as he does here – Wembley Stadium for the 12th time. Each of his albums goes to No 1; he’s played at practically every massive arena in the world. He sings with Eminem on stage; Beyoncé will perform with him. But if you only know about his life from the tabloids, or by gossip osmosis, you might know he has a pub, that he married a school friend, that he still lives in Suffolk, and has a pond that was briefly controversial. As a star, he is not so much champagne as he is pale ale. He has a homely quality to him. This homeliness belies a certain unknown aspect, though. Not unknown in the Beyoncé way, with that distant remove of a glossy machine, but unknown in the sense that his normal-guy shtick might be the extent of it. We see him as a hard worker done good. He appears to be a very nice man. The documentary – which, again, cheekier viewers might note, coincides with a high-profile court case against him, and does much to make him seem even more human and likable – foregrounds the unknown man, via the people who do know and love him, including his wife, Cherry, and his parents, John and Imogen. Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All is on Disney+ from 3 May. , How did the highly punchable Swede do? What about Ger-bear? Or Tom the corporate kiss-ass?

As the super-rich saga enters its home stretch, we’ve consulted the shareholders, analysed the optics and compiled a countdown of Succession’s major players.

You didn’t quite make the cut. Hey, that’s business. Now let’s go full fucking boar and commence the countdown … , With its voter ID ruse and a bid to capture the civil service, the government is emulating US Republicans’ winner-takes-all populism Any competition with a prize worth having attracts cheats. That is as true of politics as it is of sport. Whether cheats prosper depends on a combination of regulation and culture. There must be rules, enforced by independent institutions, but also an ethos of honouring the rules, policed by conscience. The introduction of mandatory voter ID for local elections in England this week is doubly insidious because it smuggles dishonourable intent in a measure purporting to strengthen the rules.

Book tickets here , Both parties emphasise ‘getting on the ladder’ to win middle-class votes, ignoring the vast majority of people affected by this emergency Britain is obsessed with home ownership. This might date back to our history of land ownership, class and colonial exploit but the fixation lives on, thanks in no small part to Thatcher’s introduction of the right to buy in 1980. This weekend, both parties made their bids to reckon with the housing crisis, and both leaders, predictably, zeroed in on ownership. The Tories have for years declared they would transform “generation rent” into “generation buy” and Rishi Sunak is now considering bringing back help to buy – a 2013 Tory policy that ended last year – to win votes at the next election. He also recently announced he would scrap the house-building target of 300,000 every year in England, displaying a wilful ignorance of what is actually needed to plug the housing deficit. House-building alone won’t solve the crisis, but it will hugely contribute to some of the most urgent needs in this country – namely the 1.3 million people on English council house waiting lists in need of social rented homes, many of whom are privately renting and sliding into poverty. (Meanwhile, the homes available to rent in the UK fell by a third over the past 18 months.) Kieran Yates is the author of All the Houses I’ve Ever Lived In , The list of things he derided included #MeToo, fat women, gay marriage and immigrants The theme for this year’s Met Gala wasn’t a concept; it was a person. But the organizers’ departure from their usual theming convention wasn’t the most controversial thing about the night. The real issue is that Karl Lagerfeld, the man they’ve chosen to honor, was also notoriously fatphobic, anti-immigrant, possibly homophobic and, many would say – despite his slew of famous muses – low-key misogynistic. , A contested settlement will do little to alleviate a chronic crisis which goes beyond issues of remuneration The ongoing wave of public sector strikes, some of which could continue into the autumn, has been motivated by two main factors. One – the most immediate – is the spike in inflation and the cost of living crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine. For workforces which had already endured a steady erosion of pay and living standards for over a decade, this amounted to a blow upon the bruise inflicted by austerity. The longer-term grievance relates to the more general underfunding and implicit undervaluing of public services, which successive Conservative governments have starved of necessary resources. For NHS employees especially, this has too often turned what should be the pursuit of a vocation into a quotidian exercise in putting out fires. The chronic recruitment and retention crises in our hospitals are the consequence of this dire combination of declining pay and increasingly beleaguered, morale-sapping working conditions. , Millions of children have missed routine immunisations due to the pandemic. But saving lives is about more than logistics The horror of the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it one small cause for optimism: the crisis accelerated the development of new vaccine technologies, with the potential to protect against other diseases. Yet this leap forward was accompanied by a dramatic backsliding in the delivery of existing vaccines, with 23 million children missing out on routine immunisations in 2020 and 25 million in 2021 – the largest sustained decline in three decades. The World Health Organization reports that more prevalent and severe outbreaks of preventable diseases, including diphtheria and polio, are already occurring. While three-quarters of the children who missed out lived in just 20 countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, there were declines in richer nations too. The UK Health Security Agency has warned that uptake of the meningococcal vaccine, and the last routine dose of the combined polio, diphtheria and tetanus vaccine, fell significantly last year among adolescents. Covid-19 overwhelmed healthcare systems and personnel, while lockdowns kept people away from facilities used to deliver shots. Supply chain disruption affected the availability of doses and syringes.

What would it take for us to confront greedflation today?, 28 April). Instead, I fear that Aldous Huxley was spot-on in his vision of a brave new world in which the masses are kept passive and constantly distracted by cheap thrills, soft drugs and an endless diet of trivia. More recently, Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death highlighted how the mass media has been used to provide constant puerile entertainment that distracts most of the population from serious matters of economics and politics. Most of the British public is now kept in a political stupor by endless stories about celebrities, soaps, reality TV, the manufactured melodrama surrounding the royals and the blaming of “the other” for our myriad economic and social problems – whether that “other” be refugees and migrants, supposedly idle workers, single parents, “greedy” unions, welfare claimants or the so-called liberal elite. , Tim Allen on guarding the guardians of democracy, and David Chan on the need to diversify those who work in the media The press is essential to a healthy democracy (Trust, diversity and independence: three key elements for a thriving press, 1 May). The conventional wisdom is that a “free” press is the guardian of democracy, but I would argue that it is, in fact, an unbiased press that serves that purpose. Should newspapers operate on the basis of neutrality? Perhaps they should be considered a public service. Responsible journalism should present the facts in a coherent way, with spin deciphered, and only then draw an editorial conclusion, if it is appropriate. But this cannot be the case when each publication panders to its ideological base or, more worryingly, to the interests of its owner. Then, the “free” press is a mere propaganda tool. ,  Premier League updates from the 8pm GMT kick-off Live scoreboard | And you can mail Scott your thoughts Frank Lampard talks to Sky. “We’re coming to a really good team … it’s going to be tough for us … the challenge might not be a bad thing for us, because the players have to react … we have to show what we can do … individually we know there is a lot of talent in the squad but the nature of being a team against what has become a team with a real identity here is a challenge for us … [Aubameyang] has a history of scoring goals and maybe a motivation to play here … Noni has trained really well, and when you come in with a big squad you need players who show something in training and he’s shown that … it’s a big job, it’s a challenge, as a club we’ve been really successful for a long time and this is a year of transition on many levels … that can bring obvious difficulties but also excuses and we have to put those to bed … you don’t succeed unless you have togetherness, standards, spirit, and maybe that’s been affected this year … so it’s difficult to put a time frame on it … it may take time … it has to be a collective … Arsenal are a good reference point … we’ve got a hard run-in but the players have a lot to play for … I see a team low on confidence … but the natural talent is there … this league is unforgiving … I’m very positive about the squad but the players need to work and work hard.” Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports, considers the six-day break Arsenal have enjoyed since the City defeat. “It was necessary to reset, recharge the batteries and bring some clarity again, and focus on the big game tonight … we conceded too many goals, we had to shake it up, to give people opportunities they deserve … there are players who deserve to play minutes … they have a lot of players who are great on the break and we need some control of the game … City were exceptional on the day and reached a level we could not reach, I cannot fault the players … we didn’t win enough duels the other day … there are a lot of things we have to do much better today … we must play really well tonight, be us … and if we win this game we are top of the league again with four games to go.” , Gianni Infantino threatens a World Cup blackout yet Fifa is the architect of the chronic underfunding in the women’s game Prepare the spandex: women’s football superman Gianni “I have four daughters” Infantino is here to save the day. The president of Fifa has threatened a broadcasting blackout of the Women’s World Cup in the “big five” European countries of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France, blaming bids for the broadcast rights for the tournament that he said were a “slap in the face” to the players and “all women worldwide”. ,  Chelsea forward out for ‘a significant period’ with knee injury Leah Williamson out and Beth Mead poised to miss tournament Fran Kirby is the latest England player to be ruled out of the Women’s World Cup, with Chelsea saying the forward will be absent “for a significant period”. Kirby will undergo knee surgery after an injury sustained in Chelsea’s Continental Cup semi-final against West Ham in February. England’s captain Leah Williamson is out with an ACL injury, Sarina Wiegman has said Beth Mead needs a miracle to be fit and Kirby – another important member of the team that won Euro 2022 – will not be able to travel to Australia for the tournament in July. ,  FA charge Liverpool manager with improper conduct Klopp says he regrets that his words ‘opened the box’ Jürgen Klopp has admitted the referee Paul Tierney does not have an agenda against Liverpool and that he regrets detracting from the thrilling win against Tottenham on Sunday with his touchline conduct. The Football Association has charged the Liverpool manager with improper conduct for questioning Tierney’s integrity following the 4-3 victory at Anfield. Klopp also alleged the referee had spoken in an inappropriate manner when showing him a yellow card for confronting the fourth official, John Brooks. ,  Australian set for stint in County Championship ‘It’s something I’ve never done and always wanted to do’ Steve Smith has sought to douse the gently smouldering embers of controversy surrounding his use of the County Championship to prepare himself for facing England in this summer’s Ashes, insisting that his next few weeks at Sussex will make no difference whatsoever to his chances of success once the series gets under way in June. “I don’t think that’s the case at all,” he said of the possibility England would come to regret letting him into their domestic game. “I’ve seen a lot of talk about getting used to conditions but you’ve got to remember I’ve played a lot of cricket in England before, so the conditions aren’t really new to me. I’m just keen to play some cricket.” ,  Belarusian comes from set down to beat Sherif 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 Karatsev knocks out Medvedev and Alcaraz routs Zverev The world No 2, Aryna Sabalenka, denied the unseeded Egyptian Mayar Sherif the biggest victory of her career when the Belarusian came back from a set down to win their Madrid Open quarter-final 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 on Tuesday. Sabalenka was not at her best and made 37 unforced errors in the match, but the Australian Open champion bounced back midway through the second set to win 10 games in a row and take control. Sherif, who has won only one WTA 250 title in her career, was gifted the first game of the match, winning all her points through unforced errors from Sabalenka to break the Belarusian before building a 3-1 lead. , Hidden camera at slaughterhouse appears to show ‘utterly inhumane’ use of CO2 to stun pigs before slaughter New undercover footage showing British pigs being gassed prior to slaughter has led to renewed calls to investigate the use of CO2. Campaigners say the pictures – the first of their kind to be obtained in a UK abattoir – show the “utterly inhumane” nature of using CO2 to stun pigs before being killed. But the pork industry says its use is recognised as the most welfare-friendly method available, and says alternatives are being sought. , Survey finds exhaustion and low morale among school nurses as they face increasingly complex caseloads  School nurses’ crucial, underfunded role The UK needs at least 11,000 more school nurses to deal with the increasingly complex needs of young people after the pandemic, and help prevent them from developing serious mental health problems, researchers and campaigners say. The number of school nurses has fallen by 35% in the last five years to about 2,000, and research by Oxford Brookes University, the University of Birmingham and the Oxford Health NHS foundation trust has found that a lack of long-term investment has resulted in many local areas scrapping the roles altogether. , College of Policing, covering England and Wales, looking at the crime after study shows 25% of offenders go on to carry out serious attacks Police are to formally review whether they should take indecent exposure more seriously amid emerging evidence that people who commit such crimes can escalate their offending, the Guardian has learned.

The MP, who has been outspoken in her opposition to self-identification for transgender people, told the Guardian she was “considering her options” but that she would prefer to resolve the issue privately.The Stand comedy club said Cherry’s planned appearance during the festival fringe in August had been cancelled because “key operational staff” were unwilling to work with her. , Paul Nthenge Mackenzie faces charges of terrorism, murder, kidnapping and cruelty towards children A Kenyan religious cult leader accused of inciting followers to starve to death is facing additional charges including terrorism and child trafficking. Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie, who set up the Good News International Church in 2003, appeared in court in Malindi on Tuesday. , Group has removed AI images used to promote their reports on social media, including fake photos of Colombia’s 2021 protests While the systemic brutality used by Colombian police to quell national protests in 2021 was real and is well documented, photos recently used by Amnesty International to highlight the issue were not. The international human rights advocacy group has come under fire for posting images generated by artificial intelligence in order to promote their reports on social media – and has since removed them. , Mohamed Khairullah, mayor of a New Jersey town, says he’s on list ‘that has targeted me because of my identity’ The US Secret Service denied security clearance for Mohamed Khairullah, the longest-serving Muslim mayor in New Jersey, and prevented him from attending a White House Eid al-Fitr event on Monday afternoon marking the end of Ramadan. Khairullah, who was critical of the Trump administration’s travel ban in 2017 that restricted entry to the United States from several predominantly Muslim countries, received the call from the Secret Service while he was en route to the White House. President Joe Biden revoked that ban in 2021. , Sex scene in Bruno Le Maire’s book provokes ridicule and anger among opposition politicians An explicit sex scene in a newly published novel by the French economy minister has left the government facing fresh accusations it is not listening to the concerns of the country just as it tries to contain anger over the unpopular rise in the pension age. The toe-curling sexual descriptions in the novel, Fugue Américaine, written by the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, have angered opposition politicians and inspired anti-government slogans and graffiti at street demonstrations as the government struggles to contain the political crisis over Emmanuel Macron raising the minimum pension age to 64. , Ommeren became hive of activity after Dutch National Archive unveiled map featuring a red ‘X’ in January A Dutch village that became the focus of a frenzied treasure hunt after a map allegedly showed Nazi loot buried there during the second world war has declared the search over – and said nothing was found. The small hamlet of Ommeren did conclude that there had indeed been treasure buried there, but that it was removed after the war. , Flake and Crunchie chocolate products among those potentially contaminated with bacteria Six Cadbury-branded desserts including Flake and Crunchie chocolate desserts have been recalled by their manufacturer over fears they could be contaminated with listeria. The dairy company Müller, which produces the desserts, said it was recalling various batches in the UK and Ireland as a precaution, all of which have a use-by date of either 17 or 18 May. , Federal complaint alleges Jackie Little, who had a ‘known history of arson or suspect arson’, started fires at two mosques US authorities have arrested a man accused of setting fires at two Minneapolis mosques last week and charged him with arson, an act that the city’s police chief described as a “hate crime” aimed at instilling fear in the local Muslim community. A federal complaint alleged that Jackie Little, 36, entered the Masjid Omar Islamic Center on 23 April wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and a blue medical mask and lit a cardboard box on fire in the center’s second-floor bathroom. An employee reportedly chased Little out of the location. , The Killing Eve star is in competition for best actress, while musical Some Like It Hot picks up the most nominations overall, with 13 Jodie Comer has been nominated for a Tony award for her debut performance on Broadway in Prima Facie. The Killing Eve star won best actress at the Olivier awards in London for the one-woman play, which transferred to New York in April. It stars Comer as a barrister who defends men charged with rape who is then assaulted herself. In the best actress category, Comer is up against Audra McDonald (Ohio State Murders), who has won more Tony awards than any other performer; Jessica Hecht (Summer, 1976) and Jessica Chastain, recognised for her performance in A Doll’s House, which opened on Broadway in March after its London run was scuppered by Covid. , Brace, who has died aged 43, was a hugely talented playwright, dramaturg and director who worked on a string of hits including One-Woman Show and Age Is a Feeling “The most high-profile director you’ve never heard of.” That’s what the Stage newspaper called Adam Brace late last year, after an annus mirabilis in which he seemingly worked on every great performance I watched. Liz Kingsman’s breakout hit One-Woman Show – that pitch-perfect parody of the Fleabag phenomenon – was one. Haley McGee’s for-the-ages solo show about the shape of our lives, Age Is a Feeling, was another. Throw in Leo Reich’s blazing standup debut, Sh!t Theatre’s Evita Too – and the London revival of Alex Edelman’s off-Broadway hit Just for Us – and you’ve got a man who took the idea of the magic touch to stratospheric levels. This, then, was a director-dramaturg with the world at his feet, and his death at the age of 43 is a colossal loss. In that Venn diagram where creative comedy meets compelling theatre – where, let’s face it, all the best work is made – his name on the credits was a gold standard. All the more remarkable to think that he came late to his twin passions, directing and dramaturgy, after a perfectly successful initial stint as a playwright. His play Stovepipe was co-produced by the Bush and the National Theatre; its follow-up (his last), They Drink It in the Congo, had a run at the Almeida. , Writers Guild of America calls first work stoppage in 15 years as industry grapples with streaming boom Hollywood productions have ground to a halt after thousands of film and television writers went on strike following the breakdown of last-minute pay talks with major studios. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) called its first stoppage in 15 years after failing to reach an agreement on higher pay, pitting its 11,500 screenwriters against old-guard companies, such as Universal, Paramount and Walt Disney, as well as tech newcomers, such as Netflix, Amazon and Apple. , A new study has linked siestas of 30 minutes or more with increased BMI and blood pressure. But that doesn’t mean you should avoid a little lie down Name: Napping. Age: Ancient. Before drugs, it was all we had. , Meet four people who stitch their own garments, whether for reasons of morality or creativity  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email Like many millennials, textiles (a less 1950s name for sewing lessons) was part of the curriculum  at my high school. Those classes marked the beginning and end of any attempts to make my own clothes. But I do remember the sense of satisfaction that came with using the overlocker and iron to finish a project: magically turning something crumpled and lumpy into a crisp (if misshapen) garment. This week, I spoke to four people whose creativity, patience and skillset deepened beyond their early years, allowing them to make their own clothes to this day. , With numbers of volunteers in England at a historic low, we would like to hear from people who have quit about their reasons why With numbers of volunteers in England at a historic low, we would like to hear from people who have quit about their reasons why. According to the Time Well Spent 2023 report from National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), those raising money or taking part in sponsored events fell by 48% since 2018. The report also found that those organising or helping to run an activity has fallen by 52%, from 14% to 7%. , Jamie Dimon says this phase of bank collapses is over, but ‘other cracks in the system’ could still be revealed Fresh from the rescue of First Republic, the latest US regional bank to go under, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has been talking down the threat of contagion. He claims the domino effect that started with Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and was quickly followed by Signature Bank, Credit Suisse, and now First Republic, is coming to an end. “There may be another smaller one, but this pretty much resolves them all,” Dimon told analysts on Monday. “This part of the crisis is over.” , Steve Barclay urges RCN and Unite to call off further strikes after health unions representing majority of NHS workers accept pay offer Momentum, the Labour group set up to promote Jeremy Corbyn’s agenda when he was party leader, claims that Keir Starmer could end up like Nick Clegg if he abandons his promise to abolish tuition fees. Responding to what Starmer said on this this morning (see 9.01am), Momentum spokesperson said: This move wouldn’t just fly in the face of party democracy and the wishes of Labour Students. It would be a betrayal of millions of young people in desperate need of hope. The Labour leadership should learn from Nick Clegg’s failure, not repeat it.Keir was elected on a promise to abolish tuition fees. With higher education in crisis and young people facing a future of high rents &amp; even higher debts, this pledge is more urgent than ever. Trust matters. Young people matter. The results won’t make happy reading for the Conservative party, who now have minimal support among undergraduates. While they will make happier reading for Labour, it is clear there is no single student funding model that would be overwhelmingly popular with students. This will make the opposition’s job harder as they firm up their policies in the run-up to the next [general] election. , Kremlin disputes White House figures showing Russian casualties mark an acceleration even when compared with first days of the war  Russia-Ukraine war at a glance Reuters has a quick snap to say that all parties in the Black Sea grain initiative will meet for talks on Wednesday, according to a senior Ukrainian source. The deal is, according to Russia’s timetable, due to expire on 18 May. The Kremlin has been lukewarm about the prospect of it being extended, arguing that restrictions on Russia’s banking and insurance sector have damaged the country’s own agricultural exports. Our state has already proven that it can win. We have proven that we can liberate our land from the occupier. All those who ensure the de-occupation have proven that, together with the blue and yellow flag, normal life returns for every person and every family.

Persimmon are up 5.8% in early trading, with Barratt Development (+2.5%) and Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%) and Berkeley Group (+2%) also in the top FTSE 100 risers. “Today’s heinous profits from BP are another kick in the teeth to the millions of people who can’t afford to heat their homes. BP has also quietly lowered its already weak climate targets, leaving us all to suffer even more from their climate damages whilst they line their pockets in a cost-of-living crisis. , Greg Abbott rows back on ‘inhumane’ remarks amid barrage of criticism after shooting that killed five, including a child After a barrage of public criticism from immigration advocates, Latino state lawmakers and Congress members, Texas’s Republican governor Greg Abbott has backtracked from controversial remarks he made referring to the victims of a recent mass murder as “illegal immigrants”. “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and our hearts go out to the families who have lost a loved one,” Renae Eze, a spokesperson for Abbott, told ABC News in a statement about those slain in a shooting in Cleveland, Texas, on Friday night. “Federal officials provided the state of Texas information on the criminal and the victims, including that they were in the country illegally. We’ve since learned that at least one of the victims may have been in the United States legally.” , Russian casualties mark an acceleration even when compared with first days of the war, says White House as Kremlin disputes figures  Russia-Ukraine war at a glance Reuters has a quick snap to say that all parties in the Black Sea grain initiative will meet for talks on Wednesday, according to a senior Ukrainian source.

Now, he’s part of a national effort to slash Britain’s energy use in the face of bills sent soaring by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting concerns about gas and electricity supplies. Despite having collected a total of more than £30m in cumulative pay and benefits in his time as chief executive of National Grid, Pettigrew has not forgotten his parents’ advice. “I’m the same with my family now – making sure the thermostat is turned down a few degrees, doing the sensible things,” he says. “It is the right thing to do from an environmental [and] an affordability perspective. We were very supportive of the government and other bodies advocating for people to do that.” , Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin expected to testify that columnist told them about alleged assault shortly after it happened in 1996 Jurors in E Jean Carroll’s legal action against Donald Trump for alleged rape and defamation are expected to begin hearing on Tuesday from two women who say they can back key parts of the advice columnist’s account. Carroll wrapped up three days on the witness stand on Monday as the judge in the civil case, Lewis Kaplan, denied a defense motion for a mistrial on the grounds that he had made “pervasive unfair and prejudicial rulings” against Trump’s team during its cross-examination of the former president’s accuser. , I had paid £175, the seller had disappeared and I co-operated with police but it says it can’t help At the end of last year I bought a laptop on eBay that was being sold by a third-party seller. In February the Metropolitan police emailed me to inform me the laptop had been stolen from the NHS. I returned it, as per its instructions, about 10 days later. I called eBay to obtain a refund, assuming fraudulent activity would be covered by its money-back guarantee. The seller had, by this time, disappeared from the site. , 'There's absolute secrecy​ ...​ the doctors ​I'm speaking to ​say they are being threatened from revealing test results or in many cases ​not being allowed to ​test schoolgirls​ who fear they have been poisoned.'

Email feast@theguardian.com Every Guardian recipe begins with “boil the vegetable(s)”. We always steam, believing more nutrients and flavour stay in  that way, so why are we out of step with your writers?Malcolm, NorwichRight, let’s round up some of the Guardian’s food crew and ask them to explain themselves. First to take the stand is Meera Sodha. “I’m not the sort of person to optimise anything in life, except for pleasure and ease,” she says, so when it comes to vegetables, her answer is easy: “If I’m cooking them into a meal [a curry or pan-fried dish, say], I’ll just put them in the pot or pan with all the other ingredients, where they might cook by frying, simmering or, if there’s a lid involved, part-steaming – I suppose the nutrients are captive then, so that’s a bonus!” If, however, she is serving a side of, for instance, broccoli, she’ll boil it, “because it’s quick, efficient and hands-off, which is important to me, especially if there’s something else on the bubble.” And while Sodha concedes that she could steam (“It just involves a colander and lid, after all”), she won’t be changing her ways any time soon. “I like to get to something as delicious as possible with the least amount of fuss, so boiling will always win.” For our resident perfectionist Felicity Cloake, however, the cooking method she chooses depends on what she’s making. “I steam if the vegetable is going on the plate naked with salt and oil, because I prefer the texture. But if I was adding it to another dish, I’d blanch rather than boil, because it’s more efficient.” Nutrients-wise, Cloake doesn’t have a policy: “If there are vegetables in there, I’m generally thinking nutrients are happening anyway. Although it’s obviously something to consider, and I will in future, so thank you, Malcolm.” Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com , While Suella Braverman stokes fears about new arrivals, officials tell villagers in Essex a different story. Who should they listen to? On Friday evening, Wethersfield village hall in north Essex was packed with concerned local residents firing questions at Home Office officials about the potential imminent arrival of hundreds of asylum seekers. A military airfield close to the picturesque and remote village has been earmarked by the Home Office to accommodate up to 1,700 asylum seekers as an alternative to hotel use. At the meeting, one resident asked attendees who were opposed to the plans to stand up. All 160 locals in the room leapt to their feet. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

       "250  <p>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p><p>The journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report\">concluded</a> that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html\">dropped out</a> of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”.</p><p>But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2023/05/02/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-2023/?sh=34ce6336b156\">10 richest sportspeople</a> owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978\">suspension from Paris St-Germain</a> this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

Days out from Charles’s coronation in London, campaigners for republic and reparations movements in 12 countries have written a letter asking the new monarch to start a process towards “a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence”.

An inexplicable urge to dash home and cover everything with red, white and blue bunting. Call it local elections fever. That time of the year when politicians head for their constituencies to declare the council to either be the best or the worst in the country. Or maybe it’s just that the reputation of prime minister’s questions now precedes it. The last few PMQs have been excruciating for all concerned. Whatever the reason, the Commons was sparsely populated for this week’s session. And most of those who did show up soon wondered why they had bothered.    \n",
       "250  Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder The journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently concluded that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures dropped out of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. Joe Biden, then running to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, said he would make the country a “pariah”. But that was then, and this is now – now, being when four of the world’s 10 richest sportspeople owe their place on the list to Saudi money. Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s suspension from Paris St-Germain this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns. (PSG is itself owned by Qatar, which has its own grim record on human rights.) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It requires only the professionalism to set partisanship aside when enacting government policy. That might not always be easy, and trust is not always in ready supply. Hence controversy over Labour’s recruitment of Sue Gray, a former Cabinet Office official, to serve as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. Ms Gray authored a report last year on illegal lockdown parties in Downing Street. Boris Johnson said that the investigation exonerated him, but his Conservative allies subsequently argued that the whole thing was an orchestrated campaign of subterfuge against the former prime minister, and that Ms Gray’s recruitment by the leader of the opposition proves it.    \n",

Here’s why, 29 April). This is not a novel view; it is a point well made already by Nafeez Ahmed in his critique of non-violent direct action. Anti-colonial resistance in India, for example, originated from within the oppressed communities themselves. Their aim was to force the British state to respond with such violence that the brutality of the colonial regime became apparent to the majority of the British people, whose tacit consent had been necessary for the continuation of the colonial enterprise.    \n",

Indeed, Alzheimer’s Society first funded Prof John Hardy’s amyloid research back in 1989, and it is only now that we are seeing the first amyloid-targeting treatments that show evidence of slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. While we await these new drugs, we need to improve the lives of people living with dementia so they can continue to live independently and remain in their own homes for as long as possible. We need new assistive technologies that use recent advances such as artificial intelligence to learn about people living with dementia and adapt to their changing conditions to help them keep doing the things that bring them fulfilment. To succeed, they must be designed with people living with dementia and their carers to truly meet their needs.    \n",

Elementary tap-ins at the far post. Slotted finishes into an empty net with the goalkeeper sprawled several yards away like a battlefield casualty. Two-yard headers levered from the shoulders of punier, more beta males. Penalties dispatched with all the certainty of a bow and arrow. These are the goals that gild the legend: the ballast, the meat and potatoes, the dull matter of which Premier League record goal hauls are made. And when we say simple, we should not labour under any delusions that what Erling Haaland does is easy. On the contrary: this is the culmination of perhaps the most audacious and complex project undertaken in English football. A club purchased and refitted with the sole aim of assembling and training a team whose sole aim is to deliver the ball into dangerous attacking areas, again and again and again and again.    \n",

The 68-year-old is starting in bold fashion in an attempt to bring back confidence to a team sorely lacking it at the wrong time of the season after collecting one point in their past five matches. The former England manager has four games to maintain Leeds’s top-flight status. Allardyce starts his tenure with the unenviable trip to Premier League champions Manchester City, followed by matches against former clubs Newcastle and West Ham, before finishing the campaign at home to Tottenham. It is a tough run-in for Leeds, who are currently out of the relegation zone on goal difference, sitting one place above Nottingham Forest in 17th, but Allardyce knows what he is getting into and wants six points to keep Leeds up.    \n",

Victims have felt there was little point in reporting unacceptable behaviour by elected members because it had been tolerated for so long, the report said. Plaid Cymru failed to implement a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment. Staff reported bullying and discrimination in the workplace. But any staff do not feel that there are safe systems to raise concerns, seek support or challenge what they see. They have seen too many instances of bad behaviour by elected members be tolerated and feel that there is little point in raising concerns. There has been a lack of collective leadership and governance across the party which has meant that these issues have worsened over the last few years. Measures are needed to detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny and to make Plaid truly and visibly welcoming to women.    \n",

After dining on Thursday evening at the Palace Hotel’s Amar restaurant, the trio posed for a photograph with employees. The picture was posted on Instagram by staff member Pol Perello and captioned: “Pleasures that this job brings you!!” ,  Qatari banker offers around £5bn for 100% of club Interested parties needed to make offers by 10pm BST on Friday Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have lodged final bids for Manchester United by Friday’s 10pm BST deadline. The offers are markedly less than the £6bn valuation of the club’s owners, the Glazers. Sheikh Jassim, a Qatari banker, remains intent on purchasing 100% of the club but will not pay more than what he believes United are worth. The Guardian understands this is around £5bn, roughly £1bn below the American family’s asking price. ,  Si leads 14-10 after one of the best sessions ever seen Mark Selby leads Mark Allen 7-6 in gruelling semi-final Luca Brecel staged a brave fightback to stay in his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Si Jiahui in one of the most exciting sessions witnessed at the Crucible.

Dortmund are on 61 points with four matches remaining, two points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich, who will move top if they beat bottom club Hertha Berlin on Sunday. , Colombian author’s En Agosto Now Vemos (We’ll See Each Other in August) had been just a rumour but now fans will get to read it Rumours had long circulated that an entire literary masterpiece, never seen by the public, could still be lying in a dusty safe held by the late author’s family or under lock and key at his archive at the University of Texas. On Friday Penguin Random House confirmed that an unpublished Gabriel García Márquez novel – titled En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We’ll See Each Other in August) – not only exists, but will be on shelves across Latin America in 2024. , Tree design includes names of Commonwealth nations, and poles are made from tree from Windsor estate The king and the queen consort will be anointed behind a specially created screen of fine embroidery, held by poles hewn from an ancient windblown Windsor oak and mounted with eagles cast in bronze and gilded in gold leaf, Buckingham Palace has announced. The anointing screen has been blessed at a special service at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, and will be used at what historically has been viewed as the most sacred moment of the coronation. , Wikimedia UK says it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill Wikipedia could be made inaccessible to UK readers due to issues over complying with the online safety bill, a charity affiliated with the website has warned.

The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. , Forty-year-old festival sees chefs use power tools to mix the eggs before a fork lift hoists the enormous frying pan into place Using 8,400 eggs, 25kg of venison sausage and 14 bottles of salt and pepper, New Caledonia’s giant omelette festival aims to bring people together in a region that is often divided. “It is important to have festivals like this.

It should be quite a finale, with a world-record crowd for a women’s game in excess of 53,000 expected at Twickenham as the Red Roses go head-to-head with France in a winner-takes-all Six Nations decider. The record currently stands at 42,579, set at the World Cup final at Eden Park in November. The attendance is also sure to smash the current Women’s Six Nations record, set last weekend with 18,604 watching France v Wales at the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. , In the best traditions of Fergie-time, substitute Millie Turner headed home the latest possible winning goal to help Manchester United stretch their lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to six points. The centre-back converted Katie Zelem’s much-disputed free-kick three minutes into added time to keep United’s dreams of a league and FA Cup double alive. , Different reports fly around while Fox News declines to comment on the cancellation of top TV host’s show The exact reason behind the rightwing TV host Tucker Carlson’s abrupt firing from Fox News remains unclear, days after the star’s show was suddenly cancelled. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Carlson was fired after executives discovered vulgar text messages, including one in which he called a top executive the C-word. There were also concerns among Fox management that Carlson was acting as if he was above the network, the Journal reported. , UN’s arbitrary detention group calls for immediate release of Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, saying detention has no basis in law A UN body has declared that the detention of a long-term Guantánamo inmate, Abu Zubaydah, has no lawful basis and called for his immediate release, warning that the systemic deprivation of liberty at the camp may “constitute crimes against humanity”. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD), also declared the UK, among other countries, was “jointly responsible for the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of Mr Zubaydah” over his more than 20 years in detention. , US supreme court justice, who wrote Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, denies claims he was responsible for leak in draft form Samuel Alito said the decision he wrote removing the federal right to abortion made him and other US supreme court justices “targets of assassination” but denied claims he was responsible for its leak in draft form. “Those of us who were thought to be in the majority, thought to have approved my draft opinion, were really targets of assassination,” Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. , Yemeni authorities said ‘suspicious’ and unresponsive ship opened fire, while ship manager reports clash with pirates Armed guards aboard a yacht once owned by the late Welsh actor Richard Burton have fired on approaching ships in the Gulf of Aden, prompting an intense gunfight. Yemeni authorities said the guards mistakenly opened fire on a Coast Guard vessel but the ship’s manager insisted they had clashed with pirates. The shooting reportedly killed one Yemeni Coast Guard member and wounded another person in a hail of gunfire – the guards are said to have shot as many as 200 rounds of ammunition. The incident shows the danger faced by both shippers and security forces in the waters off the Arab world’s poorest country, even as it remains crucial for global commerce. , Crowning of King Charles expected to pass quietly in New Zealand, though there is still some fascination with the crown In town halls and social media groups, New Zealand’s most committed royalists are planning high teas, concerts, and watching parties. For the most dedicated, the memorabilia will be out on display: tea sets and replica tiaras, lifetime collections of Woman’s Weekly front pages and special edition photo books. For others, however – including some of the country’s dedicated royal watchers – the coronation cupcakes and cucumber sandwiches come with a side of doubt, over the future of the monarchy and the changing way that it is viewed in colonised countries. Elizabeth Garlick will watch the coronation live, late into the night, with a group of other royal fans who are planning wine, cheese, and possibly tiaras. She says she fell in love with the royals as a small child, seeing princess Diana in the news, and over time became a “royal watcher” – keeping track of major events in the monarchy’s timeline. “I grew up in a family of other royal watchers – my great aunties, my great nana has [the queen’s] coronation on vinyl,” she says. “For me, this is like a once in a lifetime – a historical moment.” , Evacuations from Sudan, battle raging in Bakhmut, protests against a judicial overhaul in Israel and climate activism in Berlin: the most striking images this week , Government announces end to airlifts amid calls for NHS doctors without UK passports to be rescued British nationals trapped in Sudan have until midday on Saturday local time to get on a flight before they stop, ministers have announced, as a doctors’ union called for NHS medics without UK passports to also be airlifted. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Friday night more than 1,500 people had been flown out, and there had been a “significant decline in British nationals coming forward”, meaning it was time to end the operation. , Four main teaching unions could unite after ‘months of stonewalling’ from education secretary Gillian Keegan All state schools in England could be closed by “unprecedented” coordinated strikes involving all four teaching unions, after their leaders vowed to increase pressure on the government to improve its pay offer. In a joint press conference, the leaders of the four major education unions said they wanted to send a message to the education secretary that she needed to resume negotiations over pay and school funding. , The Conservative party has been too involved in the debasement of public life for too long to be entrusted with its rehabilitation The advertisement for the job of BBC chair for which Richard Sharp successfully applied in November 2020, and from which he resigned on Friday, stipulated that candidates declare any “real or perceived conflict of interest”. Care should be taken over issues that could “be misconstrued, cause embarrassment, or cause public confidence in the appointment to be jeopardised”. One such issue, in Mr Sharp’s case, was helping facilitate guarantees for a personal loan of up to £800,000 from a Canadian financier to Boris Johnson, then prime minister. When asked by the advisory assessment panel that gave the green light for his appointment about perceived conflicts of interest, Mr Sharp said everything had been properly declared. It had not. A report into the process, published on Friday, found that omission to be an unambiguous breach of the rules. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. , Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach has declared that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, has said that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings. But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration. Mr Loach is 86 and Mr Auerbach is 92 on Saturday, and they are still working. For all the challenges of age that both report, they continue to command the heights of their respective vocations – as does another great 92-year‑old artist Bridget Riley, who is about to unveil her first ceiling painting at the British School in Rome. , Conservative party accused of undermining broadcaster by flooding it with cronies after chair’s resignation Rishi Sunak is under pressure to stop appointing Conservatives to key positions at the BBC after Richard Sharp’s resignation prompted criticism the party had undermined the broadcaster by flooding it with cronies. Sharp quit as BBC chair on Friday morning after an investigation concluded he had failed to disclose key information about his relationship with the former prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job in 2021. Sharp helped facilitate an £800,000 loan guarantee for Johnson when he was in the running to take over the broadcaster but did not tell the appointments panel. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter and child cruelty by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , Record heat in southern Europe and chilly start to British growing season spell more misery for shoppers Shoppers have been warned they face more fruit and vegetable shortages, as temperatures in southern Spain soar to unprecedented levels while the UK growing season gets off to a late start because of cold, overcast weather. Temperatures were expected to reach a new April record of 39C (102F) in parts of Andalucía on Friday amid a long-lasting drought that has affected the production of vegetables in Spain. Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday. , Submarine rescue vessel SS-750 was photographed in Baltic four days before still-unexplained explosions, says Danish newspaper A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just prior to the mysterious September blasts, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage confirmed the existence of the hitherto publicly unknown photographs. , South African magnate hopes there will be bidder in auction who prefers 1,993 rare creatures to a superyacht Wanted: an animal-loving billionaire who might consider buying 1,993 threatened white rhinos instead of a new superyacht or a Picasso, or a Picasso onboard a superyacht. John Hume, a South African multimillionaire who started a rhino breeding project with about 200 animals 30 years ago, is selling all the rhinos and the 8,500-hectare (21,000 acres) conservation ranch where they live in what must rank as one of the most unusual ever online auctions. , Council’s preparations are under way but excitement is muted and some say they are unlikely to watch Chris Booth spent much of Tuesday morning supervising the installation of a crown 4.2 metres wide on the stone columns at the front of Nottingham’s Council House. The crown had been brought out of a council depot (where it is stored alongside a vast goose that appears annually for the Nottingham goose fair), repainted and had had its plastic pearls retrofitted with LED bulbs so they can be lit up at night. , Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets. Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in Avengers: Infinity War but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone). , Current science suggests that chrono-activity or adjusting our regimes to suit our body clocks, plus short, sharp workouts, are the key to a beneficial exercise routine Thousands of us have started 2023 with new exercise programmes promising to get us fit, muscle-bound and slim. But the latest science of chrono-exercise (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it. Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym. ,  Max Verstappen will start second on grid for Sunday’s race Hamilton fifth but Russell 11th after disappointing Q2 After a frustrating and stultifying opening to the new Formula One season, Ferrari finally have a moment to savour. How much it meant was clear as Charles Leclerc climbed from his car having taken pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and vigorously pointed to the prancing horse logo on his chest. Pumped by an immaculate performance, he and the Scuderia will view this as the belated opening to 2023 they wanted – but what follows this weekend will more accurately define the scale of their challenge to a dominant Red Bull. Leclerc has taken a battering in the opening three races. He suffered an engine failure in Bahrain, a 10-place grid penalty in Saudi Arabia and was unlucky to be punted out of the race on the first lap in Australia. After a week in which he has had to dismiss rumours of talks with Mercedes to join the team should Lewis Hamilton retire, and in which it was announced that Ferrari’s racing director, Laurent Mekies, is to leave to replace Franz Tost as team principal at AlphaTauri – a blow after the recent loss of technical director David Sanchez to McLaren – Leclerc delivered reason for the embattled team to finally breathe out. ,  Former England captain was strategic adviser to the ECB T20 could have two divisions and 18 teams Andrew Strauss has left his roles as strategic adviser to the England and Wales Cricket Board and chair of the performance cricket committee only three weeks after the changes to the structure of domestic cricket he recommended in last year’s high performance review were declared “dead in the water” by Richard Gould, the governing body’s chief executive. The announcement came on the day it emerged that the men’s Hundred could be abandoned in favour of a new Twenty20 competition, with the ECB said to be concerned the new format has failed to catch on internationally and was not as appealing to the cream of international talent as the widely played alternative. ,  French Open finalist’s struggles continue on clay ATP announces live electronic line calling across Tour One of the greatest challenges of being a top tennis player is remaining one, year after year, even as the rest of the field conspires to tear you down. In the first few months of his sophomore season among the elite, Casper Ruud continues to exemplify that struggle. Ruud, the French Open runner up last year, suffered another early loss on clay, losing 6-3, 6-4 to young Italian Matteo Arnaldi in the second round of the Madrid Open. A year ago, Ruud had reached the fourth round of a grand slam only once. Although he was already a top 10 player, he had a reputation for specialising in clay and thriving in the smaller events. The Norwegian blew every expectation out of the water in his breakthrough season, reaching finals at the French Open, US Open, ATP Finals and Miami Open. A match away from the top spot in New York, he finished the season having reached a career high ranking of No 2. , This debacle brought together a foolish man and a dishonest prime minister, but it also highlights the urgent need for systemic reform A word of advice for anyone who has worked hard to acquire a reputation they cherish: if Boris Johnson approaches, if he comes anywhere near, run a mile. Richard Sharp is the latest proof that, even out of office, Johnson continues to act as reputational napalm, laying waste to careers and turning good names bad. Sharp joins a long list that includes Christopher Geidt, who had the poison task of serving as Johnson’s adviser on ethics; Allegra Stratton, whom the former prime minister said had “sickened” him when she joked about a party in Downing Street, even though he had attended several himself; and the one-time rising star civil servant and current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, quoted this week as having said of Johnson, “I don’t know what more I can do to stand up to a prime minister who lies”. Each entered Johnson’s circle as a respected figure; each was diminished by their contact with the reverse Midas, the man who rots everything he touches. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist , Readers respond to Emma Beddington’s article about the embarrassment she felt at the state of the country when her French in-laws came to visit Emma Beddington writes about being embarrassed by the state of Britain when her French in-laws visited, citing various ways in which the country compares poorly with France (I saw the UK through the eyes of my French in-laws – and it was deeply embarrassing, 23 April). But she ends on a positive note, describing how her in-laws were impressed on a train when they saw “a lovely group of women sitting next to us in Hawaiian garlands, enjoying prosecco at 8am”. If that is the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s not much. I can understand Beddington’s “countrybarrassment”. Especially because there is no other country I have been so much in love with as Britain. For some 60 years, I travelled its length and breath, reading its literature, enjoying its arts. Its people were always welcoming – at least, that is what I thought, and I still think that most of the time the friendliness is sincere. , Readers lament the damage to culture resulting from the government cutting funding Sir Simon Rattle is right to voice his anxiety about the state of classical music in the UK (Simon Rattle is right: Britain is becoming a cultural desert – and that’s a political choice, 26 April). He is concerned for the future of orchestras, opera houses and large choirs as public financial subsidies dry up. I am the secretary of a very small concert-promoting society in north Hertfordshire. We too have lost local authority support, but even more concerning is the diminishing size of our audiences. , Garden charity no longer categorises slugs and snails as pests but sells items that harm them, say critics The Royal Horticultural Society has been criticised for continuing to sell products that kill wildflowers and insects, despite public messaging about protecting biodiversity. Last year, the RHS said slugs and snails would no longer be classed as pests. The leading garden charity said they were an important part of the garden ecosystem and “play an important role in planet-friendly gardening”. , Vaughn Dolphin, from Walsall, West Midlands, had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot A far-right extremist who accidentally set off a “fireball” in his own kitchen while experimenting with explosives has been convicted of terrorism offences. Vaughn Dolphin, who had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot, was found guilty on a series of charges after a jury viewed videos and incriminating conversations on social media. , With dwindling real-terms pay still a sore point, Whitehall staff feel the  Raab bullying case has only unleashed more hostility “Almost every civil servant I talk to is looking for a way out,” says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now an expert on Whitehall. It’s hardly a surprise after the past few years: civil servants have been demonised as workshy by former Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, blamed for the Partygate scandal by Boris Johnson and threatened with 91,000 job cuts. , Decision welcomed by victim after judge decided not to jail Sean Hogg from South Lanarkshire for the offence A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , Upmarket homewares and clothing retailer sees pretax profits rise 18% in post-lockdown recovery The family behind The White Company have given themselves at least £50m in payments as the upmarket homewares and clothing brand bounces back from the pandemic lockdowns. The company paid a £50m dividend to an entity controlled by the founder, Chrissie Rucker, and her husband, Nicholas Wheeler, the founder of the shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt. The group’s highest paid director, thought to be Rucker, took a further £5m in pay, up from £675,000 a year before, as a long-term bonus plan cashed in. , Woman and child die in Dnipro, while missile strikes in Uman, south of Kyiv, kill 19  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 19 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. , Nation’s guidelines say no donor should father more than 25 children in 12 families Dutch judges have ordered a man suspected of fathering more than 550 children through sperm donations to stop donating, in the latest fertility scandal to shock the Netherlands. The man, identified in Dutch media only as Jonathan M, 41, was taken to court by a foundation protecting the rights of donor children and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. , Rapporteurs also chastise the German and Namibian governments for excluding Herero and Nama minorities from talks dealing with the mass murder of their ancestors UN special rapporteurs have criticised the German and Namibian governments for violating the rights of Herero and Nama ethnic minorities by excluding them from talks over reparations for colonial crimes against their ancestors. Publishing their communication with both governments, the seven UN representatives urged Germany to take responsibility for all its colonial crimes in Namibia – including mass murder – and said it was wrong for the Herero and Nama to have been involved indirectly in talks via an advisory committee. They called on Germany to pay reparations directly to the Herero and Nama and not to the Namibian government. , Ricot Jean found dead after reportedly being kidnapped and Dumesky Kersaint reportedly killed by a stray bullet Two more journalists have been killed in Haiti in the past month as rampant gang violence has gripped the capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Ricot Jean, who worked for Radio-Tele Evolution Inter was found dead on Tuesday, a day after he was reportedly kidnapped by men wearing police uniforms. Jean was a prominent cultural activist in the Haitian capital and hosted a weekly radio show. , Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandalsFor the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films. This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other. , The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work • James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599 Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”. In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.” , Authors, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month. Join the conversation in the comments In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they have been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a memoir that wrestles with singleness, poetry that feels alive and excellent audiobooks.

The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added. This ginger, honey and citrus take on the idea involves a blender rather than a bia wun, and uses orange and lime juice instead of the more traditional calamansi juice. It’s a great refreshing drink to welcome the first warm days of spring – and to keep up your sleeve for the hotter months to come. Luke Farrell, Speedboat Bar, London W1 , On her travels Petrina Darrah would often send her mother photographs, then receive a picture of the same place three decades earlier in return  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email When I told my mum I was taking my younger sister to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she could barely contain her excitement. Thirty years before we set foot in Goma, our mother arrived in the same city on a dusty Bedford truck that had carted a swag of lanky youths all the way from London. Back then, the DRC was called Zaire and civil war had yet to tear the region apart. Mum remembers Goma as being quite cosmopolitan. , Fox News settlement seen as ‘moment of weakness’ that puts focus on  mogul’s heirs and their future “Rupert has shown a rare sign of weakness,” says one longtime Murdoch watcher. “There is something of the smell of blood in the water.” In the space of two weeks the 92-year-old’s media empire has taken a reputational hammering on both sides of the Atlantic, putting a renewed focus on the future shape of the global conglomerate’s businesses – and who will run them. , At Omdurman’s open-air market, half of the stalls are shut, customers are scarce and money is tight “I haven’t sold anything since 6am today,” said Adam Musa, a vegetable seller at Omdurman’s open-air market, as fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces raged a few miles away. “There are no people buying.” Musa, 55, faced two problems: a lack of customers, and an inability on the part of those who did come to pay what he was charging. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine. Euromaidan, Kyiv Operativ and Faytuks news have posted videos of the reported attack, which shows a large part of a residential building totally blown apart. It is unknown at this stage how many people were inside. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp. What he did there – and his role in the investigation of three deaths –remains controversial In the middle of a June night 17 years ago in the Guantánamo prison camp, guards and medical orderlies were urgently summoned to one of the inmate clinics, where an emergency was unfolding. Two inmates, Ali Abdullah Ahmed and Mani Shaman al-Utaybi, had been brought in dead. A third, Yasser Talal al-Zahrani, had been rushed to the hospital on the US naval base but was declared dead there soon afterwards. The three men were found hanging from their necks, with their hands and feet bound and rags in their throats. ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments? You can email John or tweet him Quotes coming in to preview Sunday’s games, though a lot of these will come from last night, and have been embargoed. Eddie Howe’s gone BIG with this comparison for Newcastle Alexander Isak. There are no two players who are the same but I think he does have some of the characteristics that Thierry Henry had. He has certainly got the speed and is a similar build and frame. Also the footwork. The assist [against Everton] was truly remarkable, really. He has got a lot of potential to improve and get better, but it’s been a great start for him here. Henry joined Brentford in 2016. They were a Championship side and he thought they were a stepping-stone club. He soon realised he was wrong. On Wednesday night Brentford went to Chelsea and won 2-0. They are ninth in the Premier League before hosting Nottingham Forest on Saturday and have a chance of qualifying for Europe. Brentford know how to maximise their resources. They did not panic when Smith went to Villa in 2018. Thomas Frank was an inspired appointment. The Dane led Brentford into the top flight in 2021 and has built a young, hungry side. Brentford flourished after winning promotion and have kept standards high this season. “They say the second season’s the hardest,” Henry says. “But we’ve stayed together. The gaffer said: ‘Don’t take your foot off the pedal.’ , Our selection includes a replayed shootout, a scorer of four consecutive hat-tricks and a moment to forget for Akinfenwa Much was made of the fact that, despite amassing more than 100 points each, only one of Wrexham or Notts County could win automatic promotion to the Football League. In the end the Welsh side prevailed, to the relief of their fans and Hollywood owners, consigning Notts County to the playoffs. In National League South, Ebbsfleet had no need to look over their shoulder as they hit the 100-point mark with one game remaining. The Kent side secured the title with four games to spare and sit 18 points clear of their nearest rivals, Dartford. Ebbsfleet’s march to promotion was masterminded by Dennis Kutrieb, a highly regarded young German who took over at the Stonebridge Road in June 2020, three months after the National League season was halted by the pandemic. Ebbsfleet were relegated by 0.002 of a point when clubs agreed to end the season on a points-per-game basis but have finally booked their return to the fifth tier. , The selection attempts to become only the second horse to follow up a Scottish Grand National victory at Sandown Kitty’s Light would be a hugely popular winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup on Jumps Finale day at Sandown on Saturday, and Christian Williams, his trainer, believes the seven-year-old has the right attitude and constitution to follow up his success in the Scottish Grand National last weekend. “He’s freakish for a horse,” Williams said this week. “The way he comes out of his races, you’ll never have seen anything like it. Basically, you could nearly run him in the next race as he recovers so quickly, so there’s something inside him. I’m not sure if he’s got big lungs or a big heart but there’s something in him that’s different to any other horses that we’ve run.” ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email A Tennesee lawmaker who was previously outsted for calling for gun control after a Nashville mass shooting has spoken about Zephyr being silenced. In an interview with Democracy Now, Tennessee representative Justin Jones spoke with Zephyr about the need for continued solidarity. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , PM tells Scottish Tory conference that Holyrood should instead be ‘held to account’ for not using existing powers enough Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Its producer Aaron Dessner explains how they made it For Ed Sheeran, the release of a new album usually means a confident sweep to No 1 and steady dominance of the Top 40 over the subsequent months. But there is more at stake than usual for the 32-year-old songwriter when he releases his fifth album, – (Subtract), next Friday (5 May). The record documents a series of events last spring that Sheeran has characterised as the most challenging period in his life. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a tumour that couldn’t be operated on until after the birth of their second child. His best friend, music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, died aged 31 after taking cocaine. Sheeran was also subject to a high-profile UK court case in which he faced claims he had copied a pair of songwriters’ work in his 2017 smash hit single Shape of You. , New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff. The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT announced fresh action. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp.

I recommend baking them in heavily buttered muffin tins or silicone moulds; baker Julia Aden recently recommended putting a round piece of greaseproof paper in the base of each mould to help remove small cakes, and it works a treat. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine.

Their justification? That Zephyr’s interaction with protesters who were demonstrating against her earlier silencing by the House’s Republican majority amounted to “encouraging an insurrection.” The Associated Press reports that such claims have become increasingly common in recent months in state legislatures where Republicans rule. Case in point, the rhetoric used by GOP lawmakers to briefly expel two Democrats from the Tennessee state House of Representatives earlier this month. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , Officials named remains as those of Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on fishing trip in 1998 Nevada officials have identified remains found in Lake Mead as those of a Las Vegas man missing for 25 years, the latest development in a quest to identify a series of bodies discovered in America’s largest reservoir last year. On three different days last summer, visitors at a beach on the lake discovered skeletal remains along the shoreline. The Clark county coroner’s office announced on Thursday that those remains belonged to the same person, now identified as as Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on 14 July 1998 at the age of 52. , Former England captain talks about his ‘tiring’ condition in Netflix series about his life and career  What are typical symptoms and treatments for OCD? David Beckham has revealed how living with his “tiring” obsessive compulsive disorder leads him to spending hours cleaning and organising his home while the rest of his family are in bed. The former England football captain, 47, says in a forthcoming Netflix documentary: “The fact that when everyone’s in bed I then go around, clean the candles, turn the lights on to the right setting, make sure everywhere is tidy.

The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong.

You have your own losses – and young children – to deal with I am a woman in my late 30s, married with two small children with a rewarding and demanding career. I live some hours’ drive away from where I grew up and where my mum lives. I really love my life   but I need some advice regarding my relationship with my mum. My lovely dad died last year.  He was much loved and I miss him a great deal, but he gave me so much over his lifetime that I am doing OK without him. My family has probably had more loss than most. One sister died before I was born, and another older sister in her early 30s. My mum has called the loss of my dad the hardest of all. I love her very much but I feel responsible for her and guilty that I live far away.  , On his show Carlson railed against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and apologized for Putinist aggression. None of it is new Fox News has finally broken ties with its most popular star, Tucker Carlson. His ousting has been bemoaned by some commentators, who have taken Carlson to be a rebellious anti-war populist, evading easy political characterization. But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology? In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a pro-Russia monologue urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the real enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States. … It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence. , Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have both been accused of ethics violations – and John Roberts refuses to discuss the matter with Congress It was a short letter. John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, was brief in his missive to Democratic senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence”, Roberts declined to appear before the committee to discuss disturbing recent revelations of ethics violations at the court. Congress is meant to exert checks on judicial power – to investigate or even impeach judges who abuse their office or interpret the law in ways that violate its spirit, and to affirm that the elected branches will hold more sway over policy than the appointed one. But the chief justice’s show of indifference to congressional oversight authority reflects a new reality: that there are now effectively no checks on the power of the court – at least none that Democrats have the political will to use – and that the justices can be assured that they will face no repercussions even if they act in flagrant violation of ethical standards. It seems that they intend to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race. Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation. , Tyler Dupree, James Harrison and Matty Ashton have left part-time rugby league behind and are now in line to face France  Ever heard the one about the electrician, the lifeguard and the builder who went on to represent their country? There could be as many as 15 debutants when a new-look England side takes to the field against France in Warrington on Saturday afternoon, with Shaun Wane sticking to his promise of ripping up the squad that fell short in last year’s Rugby League World Cup and integrating a younger group of players in anticipation for the next tournament in France in 2025. All of those players have their own unique stories to tell, but three in particular can scarcely believe they have reached this point. As recently as 18 months ago, Tyler Dupree and James Harrison were not even full-time Super League players, with Dupree involved in the Oldham side relegated to League 1, the sport’s lowest professional tier, and Harrison playing for Featherstone Rovers. They were released by Leeds and Bradford respectively as teenagers, told they were not good enough and, cast aside from the professional ranks, forced to go part-time. , Suella Braverman flags statutory instrument to public order bill as climate protesters renew campaign Suella Braverman is to give police the power to ban slow walking in traffic by protesters, as Just Stop Oil enters the fifth consecutive day of using the tactic in the latest phase of its climate protest campaign.

       "      <td>[Figure is acceleration in casualties, with most troops killed in brutal trench warfare for eastern city of Bakhmut  Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and more than 80,000 injured in just five months of fighting in Ukraine, an acceleration in already heavy losses for Moscow, US intelligence officials estimate. Most of the troops were killed in brutal trench warfare for the small eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia has repeatedly claimed it was on the brink of capturing, White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said when he revealed the new estimate on Monday. , Ukraine intercepts 15 out of 18 missiles as Moscow launches strikes apparently designed to hamper Kyiv’s plans for a counteroffensive  Russia-Ukraine war: latest news updates Russian missile strikes have injured 34 civilians and apparently damaged railway infrastructure and an ammunition depot in south-eastern Ukraine, hours before an explosion inside Russia derailed a freight train. The attacks on both sides of the border on Monday apparently aimed to disrupt military logistics before a significant Ukrainian counteroffensive against occupying Russian troops, expected to start shortly in the south or the east. , US estimates 20,000 Russian soldiers have died in five months; two killed in latest Russian strikes on Ukraine Russia’s military has suffered 100,000 casualties in the past five months in fighting against Ukraine, mostly in the Bakhmut region, the White House has estimated. National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the figure, based on US intelligence estimates, included more than 20,000 dead, half of them from the Wagner group. Russia unleashed a fresh missile attack on Ukraine in the east, killing two people, setting off huge blazes and damaging dozens of homes and other buildings in the city of Pavlohrad. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the two deaths in his video address on Monday night. “Forty other people - women, children, men – were treated for wounds and injuries,” he said. Zelenskiy also said a 14-year-boy was killed near his school when it was hit by a bomb in the Chernihiv region, close to the Russian border. An explosion in the western region of Bryansk bordering Ukraine derailed a Russian freight train on Monday, the local governor said in a social media post. “An unidentified explosive device went off, as a result of which a locomotive of a freight train derailed,” Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram, adding that there were no casualties reported. Russian authorities say the region, which borders Ukraine and Belarus, has seen multiple attacks by pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups in the 14 months since Russia invaded. Ukrainian counterattacks have ousted Russian forces from some positions in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, but the situation remains “quite difficult”, a top Ukrainian general has said. However, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, added: “At the same time, in certain parts of the city, the enemy was counterattacked by our units and left some positions.” Syrskyi made the remarks while visiting frontline troops on Sunday, the military said. The head of the Wagner private militia renewed his appeal to Russia’s defence ministry to increase ammunition shipments to his fighters trying to seize Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin has frequently clashed with Moscow’s defence establishment over the conduct of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine and what he says is insufficient support being provided to his Wagner soldiers. In a video posted on his Telegram channel, Prigozhin said he needs at least 300 tonnes of artillery shells a day for the assault, Reuters reported. Since last summer Russia has built “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades” in the areas it controls in Ukraine as well as in its own border regions, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a statement condemning the former children’s ombudsman of Russia, Pavel Astakhov, for comments he made on Russian state TV that murdering ambassadors is “within the framework of international law”, with specific reference to Poland’s ambassador. Poland called on Russia “to ensure the safety of all diplomats in accordance with the Vienna Convention”. In Washington, House speaker Kevin McCarthy emphatically stressed his support for military aid to Ukraine on Monday, criticising Russia’s “killing of the children” and distancing himself from some in his party who oppose additional major US aid to repel the Russian invasion. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken to New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins. Ukraine’s president said the pair discussed “further cooperation on defence and humanitarian issues” and “the need for further consolidation of the countries of the Pacific region in supporting Ukraine.” , Watching sea snakes swim through water is soothing – until you remember they are real Sea snakes are, in animal form, the feeling the deep end of the pool gives you when you are a child, when suddenly you feel you are swimming at night, or when you are in bed but not totally sure the floor beneath hasn’t turned into water and sharks. And because sea snakes aren’t where they’re meant to be – everything you know tells you snakes don’t belong in the sea – the more you learn about them, the more you encounter all that you don’t know: the words are weird, you understand their meaning but can’t read their letters, they are words in a dream – or was it a nightmare? Black-banded sea kraits, a type of sea snake, hunt with yellow goatfish; in New Caledonia, they are called “stripy sweaters”. Kraits are “elapid”, which means their fangs are always erect. Sea snake lungs are almost as long as their bodies; they can breathe through their skin. Their tongues are shorter than those of land snakes: only the forked part pokes out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup , A House of Lords report is right to demand action to restore lost possibilities to the under-30s An estimated three-quarters of young people aged between 18 and 24 voted remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Many did so in the conviction that leaving the European Union would turn Britain into a smaller, more insular place, closing off possibilities and prospects in their own lives. They feared a birthright was being lost; one which allowed them a bigger, wider sense of belonging. Seven years on, that judgment is vindicated in a report by a cross-party committee of the House of Lords. Entitled The Future UK-EU Relationship, the peers’ analysis finds that, since the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with Brussels in 2021, “post-Brexit barriers to mobility between the UK and the EU, in both directions, have had an especially significant impact on young people”. , Building a healthier, more prosperous country will mean addressing the problem of low-paid, precarious employment  What’s the best way to fix Britain’s economy? According to Labour and the Conservatives, the answer is growth. Yet this focus overlooks another fundamental reason for Britain’s sluggish productivity. The UK is unwell. Every year, 2% of its GDP – or £43bn – is lost due to poor health, according to new findings from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). More people are leaving work due to long-term health conditions and more are claiming disability benefits. So long as this persists, calling for growth will be like attempting to compete in a race while being too sick and exhausted to run. The reasons for Britain’s ill health have been widely discussed. Poverty is a major cause. Those on low incomes are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and struggle to afford life’s essentials. If social housing was plentiful, nutritious food subsidised and heating permanently affordable, poverty would not be as harmful to health. But a decade of cuts to public services has left those on low incomes even more exposed. Meanwhile, Whitehall has focused its energies on the NHS, viewing medical treatment as the job of the state and prevention as the responsibility of individuals. Broader health has not been a government priority – a fact signalled by the cynical decision to scrap Public Health England in 2020. , Readers take issue with Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman’s  rhetoric on asylum seekers’ ‘values’ As a volunteer with an organisation helping to support refugees and asylum seekers in Hertfordshire, I have to take issue with Robert Jenrick when he says that their “values and lifestyles” threaten the UK’s social cohesion (‘Values and lifestyles’ of small boat refugees threaten social cohesion, says Jenrick, 25 April). The asylum seekers I have met have been polite, charmingly grateful for our help and eager to get on with their lives. This means working to improve their English – at college, as soon as they are eligible – and, since asylum seekers are not allowed to earn money, keen to volunteer their services to charities and other organisations. The parents are as concerned for their children’s wellbeing as any UK parents, care for them lovingly and encourage them to work hard at school. Meanwhile, they are coping with the trauma of lives disrupted by violence, the turmoil of their journeys to get here and the stresses of living, usually in one room, in a strange country where they are dependent on the kindness of strangers for clothing, shoes and all the necessities of life. In my view, the UK will benefit immeasurably from their presence and the skills and values they bring. Vicky WoodcraftTrustee, Herts Welcomes Refugees , Sudanese crisis | Food prices | Tory foot soldiers | Value of the monarchy | Swearing allegiance I await with interest the UK government’s response to the Sudanese refugee crisis. Given the precedent of providing refuge for those escaping the war in Ukraine, we could reasonably expect that the same would apply to those fleeing violence in Sudan, and that British families would open their doors to them. After all, Britain has been far more closely associated with Sudan than with Ukraine, having had a history of occupation stretching back 150 years.Douglas CurrieEdinburgh • After reading Andy Beckett’s piece on profiteering (Britain once rioted over the price of bread. What would it take for us to confront greedflation today?, 28 April), I went for my weekly shop to a major supermarket (bill double what it used to be). I wanted a small tub of mustard and cress, but it was 60p. I went to my local farm shop, where the same thing cost me 30p.Helen PeirceTeignmouth, Devon ,  Belgian defeats four-time world champion 18-15 in final ‘This has been a crazy week, no practice, just partying’ It may have taken him nine years more than he originally planned, but Luca Brecel’s childhood prophecy has finally been fulfilled. Before he had even stepped through the doors of a Crucible Theatre as a highly-rated 17-year-old, becoming the youngest player in the tournament’s history, the Belgian had already predicted he would become world champion by the age of 19. That, clearly, did not materialise as planned. Brecel hadn’t even won a match here as recently as three weeks ago, going out in the first round on all five of his previous appearances at the Crucible. But now, snooker has its first world champion from mainland Europe and the boy who first picked up a cue as a precocious nine-year-old has delivered on his promise. ,  Wolfsburg win in extra time in WCL semi-final Eidevall says his side is ‘allowed to hurt tonight’ Jonas Eidevall said his Arsenal side is “allowed to hurt tonight and feel empty, but we are also allowed to feel proud of the performance and the occasion”, following a 3-2 semi-final defeat against Wolfsburg deep into extra time to end dreams of a place in the Champions League final. “We made it to the Champions League semi-final and lost by the tiniest of margins,” the Arsenal manager said. “With all the injuries we have, with all the challenges we have, I am incredibly proud.” , An interrogative exhibition at the New-York Historical Society examines the social, cultural and civil rights impact of development and devastation “I want people to understand that the environmental crisis is bound up inextricably in our cultural world and how we relate to each other,” Dr Wendy Nālani E Ikemoto is discussing Nature, Crisis, Consequence, which she curated for the New-York Historical Society. The show juxtaposes classics of 19th-century American naturalism with works by artists from communities largely left out of the historical narratives that these works have been central in enshrining. “It’s not just a problem of science and numbers, it is indivisible from the way we treat each other. How is the environmental crisis also a civil rights crisis?” Running through 16 July, Nature, Crisis, Consequence emerged from a request made of Ikemoto to create a show to feature the NYHS’s 19th-century Hudson River school paintings. Among the Society’s most popular holdings, the Hudson River school works show a romanticized, pastoral version of well-known landscapes upstate from New York City, now thoroughly marked by human development and activity. “They wanted them back on view because they’re so popular,” said Ikemoto, “but I didn’t want to just put these paintings back on the wall.” , Greenpeace Belgium working to release 14 protesters who sailed inflatables into the Fluxys LGN terminal in Zeebrugge Fourteen Greenpeace activists have been held for more than 48 hours after trespassing into and occupying a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal in Zeebrugge, Belgium Greenpeace Belgium said it was working for their release. Valerie Del Re, director of Greenpeace Belgium, said: “It’s not our activists, but gas companies like Fluxys who are the criminals in this story. , Exclusive: up to 10 disused cruise liners, ferries and barges sought to help tackle processing delays The Home Office is planning to use 10 redundant cruise ships, ferries and barges to house asylum seekers in ports around the country, with Liverpool expected to be next in line as ministers struggle to get to grips with the asylum backlog. Officials have been told to look at “all options” to find housing for people caught up in processing delays, including former military camps and prisons, with the total backlog more than 1,500 higher than in December when Rishi Sunak pledged to clear it within a year. , Carl O’Keeffe was taken to hospital after incident at Kong Adventure Centre but died from his injuries The family of a man who died after getting stuck in a cave at an indoor climbing centre in the Lake District say they have been left “broken-hearted”. Carl O’Keeffe, a 49-year-old man from Lancaster, was attending a birthday party with his niece in the Kong Adventure Centre in Keswick, Cumbria on 22 April, Sky News reported. , Move by senior party figures comes after fellow MP said she was worried about how force was handling crimes against woman Labour MPs have spoken to Leicestershire police after Stella Creasy expressed concern about how the force was “dealing with crimes against women” in response to their handling of her harassment case. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, and Liz Kendall, the shadow health secretary, spoke to police after Creasy criticised their handling of a harassment case against a troll who made a baseless complaint about her to social services. , Supporters claim government to rule she broke civil service code in bid to delay role as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Former senior official Sue Gray is facing a “political witch-hunt”, allies believe, with the government set to conclude that she broke the civil service code, in an alleged bid to delay her appointment as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff until after the next general election. Ministers are expected to announce on Tuesday that an internal inquiry into Gray’s departure from Whitehall has concluded that she breached the code by holding talks with Labour about the new role without informing civil service officials. , FSB says business confidence is rising but soaring costs and weakening demand is still slowing growth Small businesses across Britain are warning that the cost of living squeeze is holding back economic growth, after two in five company bosses reported a drop in sales at the start of the year. The Federation of Small Businesses said that although business confidence was rising among bosses before the summer, soaring costs and weakness in consumer demand were still weighing on activity. , Prof Marian Knight says action needed to improve diagnosis of condition in which fertilised egg implants itself outside womb  ‘Worst thing that’s ever happened to me’: the trauma of ectopic pregnancy Women are dying or suffering avoidable harm because of a failure to recognise ectopic pregnancy, one of the country’s leading experts on maternal health has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Prof Marian Knight of the University of Oxford, who leads a national research programme on maternal deaths, called for action to improve diagnosis of the acute, life-threatening condition, in which a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb, normally in the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are never viable and if left untreated can result in the tube rupturing, causing potentially fatal internal bleeding. , Critical shortages of basic goods including water, and bodies piling in streets creating ‘environmental catastrophe’ Sudanese medics have described seeing piles of bodies in the streets of the capital, Khartoum, people drinking polluted water, and doctors working under bombardments as the battle between the country’s two warring generals continues despite a threadbare ceasefire. Intense explosions and shelling were audible in Omdurman, Khartoum’s twin city across the Nile, on Monday and there were reports of further explosions and clashes in the Bahri and Kafouri districts of Khartoum North. In the south of Khartoum, residents reported that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fired anti-aircraft missiles in response to bombardments by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). , The network and Trump had a difficult relationship when he was in office, but the event could goose both of their ratings The announcement that CNN will host a New Hampshire town hall event for Donald Trump was met with widespread criticism on Monday. Angelo Carusone, chief executive of Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog, said: “The transparent attempt to goose their ratings does feel at least a little odious. But all the more reason that they need to get this right.” , Writer tells New York jury George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, encouraged her to take legal action The advice columnist E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump for rape after she was encouraged to take legal action by George Conway, the husband of a top aide to the then president. On her third day on the witness stand, Carroll told the jury hearing her lawsuit for battery and defamation over the alleged sexual assault in a New York department store changing room in 1996 that she did not intend to sue Trump until he called her a liar when she went public with her accusations more than two decades later. , Have you cringed so hard you turned into a fossil?

Today’s dishes are great for impressing vegetarian friends or family, or if you simply want a meat-free dish without feeling as if you’re missing out. If you don’t want to use tofu, swap it for crunchy veg, such as carrot, asparagus or spring cabbage, to create a contrasting texture for the noodles. , Advance raises prospect of new ways to restore speech in those struggling to communicate due to stroke or motor neurone disease An AI-based decoder that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text has been developed, in a breakthrough that allows a person’s thoughts to be read non-invasively for the first time. The decoder could reconstruct speech with uncanny accuracy while people listened to a story – or even silently imagined one – using only fMRI scan data. Previous language decoding systems have required surgical implants, and the latest advance raises the prospect of new ways to restore speech in patients struggling to communicate due to a stroke or motor neurone disease. , Discovery could help plug gaps in understanding of evolution after Cambrian explosion more than 500m years ago Many people discovered new interests closer to home as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. For Dr Joseph Botting and Dr Lucy Muir, it was a 10-metre-wide quarry in a sheep field near to their home in Llandrindod, central Wales, which appeared to be teeming with tiny fossils. Now researchers believe the site could help plug gaps in scientific understanding of how evolution proceeded after the Cambrian explosion – the period when the ancestors of most modern animals are believed to have evolved. It could even prove to be as important as the Burgess Shale in Canada that preserves one of the world’s first complex marine ecosystems, experts say. , Global fleet has more than doubled in two decades, with more private flights made last year than ever before Sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year, placing an increasing burden on the planet, while many of the owners escape aviation taxes, and there are few curbs on the greenhouse gases emitted, according to a report. The global fleet of private jets has more than doubled in the last two decades, and more private flights were made last year than ever before, according to a thinktank report published on Monday. Greenhouse gas emissions from private aviation have increased by nearly a quarter since the pandemic, when flying of all types nearly ceased in many countries for an extended period. , The Guardian’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world , Freight train derailed in border region of Bryansk; children among those injured in attack that appeared to target ammunition depot  At a glance: what we know on day 432 of the invasion Hello, and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone.

After weekend talks to prevent a further escalation of the US banking crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. The regulator is providing $50bn (£39.9bn) of financing as part of the deal. , From Lady Chatterley’s Lover to novels about trans children, attempts to suppress works of literature tend to have the opposite effect The 17th century rector of St Alban’s College in Valladolid, Spain, must have rolled his eyes at the size of the book he had to review for the library. The Jesuit seminary, known as the English College because it produced missionaries committed to the reconversion of England to Catholicism, had received a 900-page volume of Shakespeare’s plays. William Sankey prepared his quill and began the long work of censoring ungodly, anti-Catholic and otherwise unsuitable material. “Holy-day fools” – a jibe in the Tempest that seemed to impugn the Christian calendar – struck out. “Heavier soon by the weight of a man”, as Margaret tells Hero on the eve of her wedding in Much Ado About Nothing – filth – blotted into unreadability with heavy ink. A play about a pretend friar and a novice nun: actually, at Measure for Measure Sankey admitted defeat, put down his pen and took a sharp blade to cut out the pages of the entire play. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Dozens of nurses have gathered outside London’s University College Hospital, chanting and singing. Waving placards that demand fair pay and state “enough is enough”, the nurses asked how they could be expected to get by on their current pay, and said they are unable to provide acceptable care to patients due to staffing issues. As staff lined the steps of the hospital, cancer care staff nurse Preya Assi, from Hackney in east London, said: This is a culmination of our pay not reflecting the hours we are working. The last decade has made things considerably worse. Our colleagues are out in force because things have got so bad that we cannot pay our rent or our bills, we are relying on food banks. We have spent the last few years fighting the pandemic. It matters to us and the care we provide matters to us. The fact the government are not looking at our pay has caused us to do this. It’s a profession that I love, I love caring for people, and when I started the job it was not like this. The money was small, but it was sufficient, and we were proud of being a nurse. The definition of nursing is about caring for people and making them comfortable if they are at the end of their lives, but how is that possible when there is one nurse having to look after 10 patients at a time because we’re short-staffed? How am I supposed to live? If I don’t pay my council tax, they take me to court, or if I don’t pay my rent, I lose my home. At 70, I’m still working; what life is that? They are clapping for us but refuse to pay us properly. If they (politicians) were here, I would tell them to their faces. , Officials claim material on Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”. Officers on the parliamentary estate forced people attending a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on Hong Kong last Monday to hand over copies of a report by the group about press freedom there, as well as leaflets campaigning for the release of the media tycoon Jimmy Lai. , Bird flu, higher costs and the rise of meat-free options are pushing poultry producers to reduce flocks or give up entirely James Mottershead’s family has been in the chicken farming business for two decades, but nothing compares with the current situation. “Absolutely dire,” is his summary. Based in Shropshire and operating from six vast sheds that churn out 1.3m chickens a year, the business has been hit by a cocktail of pressures. , Unlike the coronation quiche, there wasn’t a broad bean in sight when we asked readers to name their most-loved combinations. From chorizo to asparagus to king trumpet mushrooms, which should you try? Compared to the super-elaborate swiss-roll-and-amaretti trifle introduced to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee last year, King Charles’s coronation quiche seems an underwhelming choice. Its chief innovation – the addition of broad beans – is seasonal but unexciting. And at the end of the day, it’s still just a quiche. Surely, we thought, Guardian readers could do better. An appeal for your own favourite quiche variations was launched. Submissions flooded in. Many refused to enter into the spirit of the exercise – “I hate quiche!” was one, not atypical response. But plenty of variations – from the humble to the exotic to the, frankly, quixotic – were offered up. I was determined to replicate three of them. , A pioneering singing programme from opera houses across Britain is bringing joy to those still struggling with little support I can’t say there’s been a lot of joy having long Covid, but something rather wonderful is happening at the London Coliseum. As part of the English National Opera (ENO) Breathe programme, more than 2,500 of us across England have been meeting in groups on Zoom to do various breathing and vocal exercises, and sing lullabies. This is not a choir, but a social prescribing intervention that uses singing techniques for breathing retraining to aid recovery from Covid-19. Many patients with long Covid have reported that they permanently feel in “flight or fight” mode and struggle to “rest and digest” as the body should. Research shows that this is because of an imbalance in our autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for subconscious processes such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and temperature regulation. Using breathing and other techniques has been shown to help engage a key nerve, the vagus, which can calm an overstimulated system to address this imbalance and put on the brakes. Joanna Herman is a consultant in infectious diseases in London, and teaches at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , With households feeling the squeeze, more retailers are offering dual-use furnishings and gadgets From colourful cushions that look as good in the living room as on the lawn to portable lamps and speakers fit for home working and garden parties, a new breed of versatile household products allows you to economise by furnishing your home and garden in one go. Traditionally, Britons have bought dedicated garden kit but with household finances under pressure and a growing desire to shop more sustainably, retailers have turned to selling “indoor-outdoor” furnishings and gadgets. “We’re seeing customers buying products that have a dual use and look just as good inside the home as they do out,” says the John Lewis head of home accessories, Camilla Rowe. , Many states have restricted how schools can teach race and gender, but only Texas has banned student interaction with elected officials The defining experience of Jordan Zamora-Garcia’s high school career – a hands-on group project in civics class that spurred a new city ordinance in his Austin suburb – would now violate Texas law. Since Texas lawmakers in 2021 passed a ban on lessons teaching that any one group is “inherently racist, sexist or oppressive”, a little-noticed provision of that legislation has triggered a massive fallout for civics education across the state. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Nine out of 10 teachers in England have a negative view of Ofsted, according to a new poll that comes amid calls to overhaul the schools inspectorate following the death of headteacher Ruth Perry. The survey of 1,000 teachers carried out by YouGov last week found that just 7% had a favourable view of Ofsted while 90% said they had an unfavourable view; including 67% who had a “very unfavourable” view of the organisation headed by chief inspector Amanda Spielman. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election? And not least of the reasons for making that the benchmark is that, if you look at what happened before the 1997 general election when Tony Blair won a landslide for Labour, Labour in the local elections leading up to 1997 were regularly recording double-digit leads in what we call the projected national share. , Officials claim material about Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”.

Prof Sir John Curtice said those wanting a clue as to who could win the next general election should be focused on the projected national vote share as the results of Thursday’s poll roll in, rather than on the number of council seats gained. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election?

But by drawing on a heritage that stretches from Birmingham to Mozambique, his new music is his most confident yet ‘Every problem you have is down there when you’re up here,” says Doya Beardmore, AKA Skinny Pelembe, overlooking his home town of Doncaster. This hillside is key to his new album, Hardly the Same Snake, its exact position revealed in morse code during one song and via clues in the artwork. He came here to de-stress when his dad was ill, before he died, and he would love to lead his listeners here via the album for a special gig. “I bet only two fucking mega-fans would turn up,” he laughs. , The particles could be linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s Researchers at the University of Vienna have discovered particles of plastic in mice’s brains just two hours after the mice ingested drinking water containing plastic. Once in the brain, “Plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s,” Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes. Adrienne Matei is a freelance journalist ,  Arsenal manager seeks end to winless run against Chelsea Frank Lampard sees Gunners as example for rebuilding Blues The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has insisted the title race “is not over”, but accepts the destiny of the trophy is “not in our hands” after his side lost 4-1 to Manchester City last week. Arteta added that his side clearly need to improve if they hope to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, starting with a win over Chelsea on Tuesday. Arsenal have been overtaken by City at the top of the table following a winless run of four games, including draws with Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton. , Newspapers’ power is being eroded and disinformation is rife – but there is a way forward Our understanding of the world is driven by information. It feeds our ability to make informed decisions about our lives, our communities, the way we’re governed. This fundamental freedom, the power to be able to access reliable information, sits at the heart of a thriving democratic society. But increasingly that power is being eroded. Indeed, some never had it to begin with. Press freedom is being threatened, compromised and denied in an increasing number of countries around the world.

Paetongtarn, the youngest daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, posted a picture of her baby, named Prutthasin Sooksawas, nickname Thasin, on social media on Monday. , Strike affecting half of NHS England trusts as pay dispute continues  Cullen has defended her union’s support for the ongoing strikes, despite previously recommending nurses accept an offer from the government. Speaking about the offer and the decision by RCN members to reject it, Cullen told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: What our nursing staff said was it was neither fair nor reasonable – it puts money in their pockets now but in the long term it doesn’t address recruitment and retention issues. There were some elements of the pay offer that were attractive to our ruling council; for example around safe nurse staffing policy work that’s required in order for us to be able to move to a place where we have safe nurse staffing legislation in place. Patients will still be seen if they unfortunately need to use an emergency department, of course that will always happen. But the delivery of care may be delayed if it is not a life-threatening emergency. If it is an emergency, you will be treated as normal. That’s why we are really emphasising the importance of people not delaying seeking medical help and calling 999 as normal or using 111. But it is inevitable that there will be disruption to normal care even in those services where we have agreed mitigations with the Royal College of Nursing. Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe. And those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition. They don’t turn their back on patients, they will continue to do what they need to do. , Fair Judgement raises funds for case in response to death of Berkshire primary headteacher Ruth Perry A group of senior school leaders is calling on teachers to donate £1 each to launch a legal challenge against Ofsted, pledging to hold the inspectorate to account for “ending careers” and causing a mental health crisis. The vice-president of the Conservative education society, John Bald, a former Ofsted inspector, is fronting a crowdfunding page for the group, which is called Fair Judgement. The leaders fear the inspectorate may seek to punish their schools if they go public.

He is expected to land in Aberdeen on Monday morning, saying on Truth Social – the social media platform he owns – that he will be opening a “spectacular” second course at the controversial Menie Estate in the north-east of the country. , Discharge of raw sewage is mainstream concern in first local elections since Guardian revealed scale of problem River pollution has become a leading issue on doorsteps during the countdown to the local elections on Thursday. Thousands of seats are being contested across England, the largest number since 2019 when the Conservatives lost control of several councils. These are the first local elections since the Guardian revealed the hidden scandal of the scale of raw sewage pollution in rivers, pushing the issue into the mainstream political debate. , The Scottish-Australian chef’s death was confirmed by his family, who said they were ‘devastated’ after he died on Sunday  Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast Jock Zonfrillo, judge on MasterChef Australia, chef and author, has died at the age of 46.

Prigozhin, whose group is spearheading Russia’s attack on the embattled city of Bakhmut, predicted a Ukrainian counterattack in mid-May and said Wagner had “only 10-15% of the shells that we need.” Pope Francis has said that the Vatican is involved in a peace mission to try to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I am willing to do everything that has to be done. There is a mission in course now but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it,” Pope Francis told reporters during a flight home after a three-day visit to Hungary. The Russian army replaced its highest ranking general in charge of logistics, after days of rumours about the sacking of Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said Alexei Kuzmenkov – a former official from the National Guard – had replaced Mizintsev as “deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation, responsible for the logistical support of the Armed Forces.” The statement did not say why Mizintsev was replaced after just seven months in the job. Ukraine said its troops were holding on to parts of the eastern city of Bakhmut. “The enemy is unable to take control over the city, despite throwing all its forces into the battle and having some success,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said its forces had taken four blocks in western Bakhmut on Sunday, according to Reuters, which could not independently confirm the claim. Four people have been killed from an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka, the governor of Russia’s western Bryansk region said on Sunday. “Two more civilians have been found and removed from the rubble. Unfortunately, both of them died,” local governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Russian commanders have likely started “punishing breaches in discipline by detaining the offending troops in ‘Zindans’ which are improvised cells consisting of holes in the ground covered with a metal grille,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. The army is thought to have been using “increasingly draconian” measures to enforce discipline since autumn 2022, the MoD said, and “especially since Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov assumed command of the operation in January 2023.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a “long and meaningful” telephone conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The French presidency said Macron had reaffirmed France’s support for Ukraine to Zelenskiy, and that Macron had given an update on European coordination to give Ukraine military help. Funerals were held for some of the 23 people who were killed on Friday when two Russian missiles hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city Uman. Six children were among the dead. With Reuters and AFP , Thirty years after the racist murder of his friend, Brooks wants to run the city whose police failed him and so many others – as a Conservative. What makes him think he can do better than Sadiq Khan? Saturday 22 April was the 30th anniversary of the day Stephen Lawrence was murdered by racist youths while waiting for a bus in south-east London. Lawrence’s family along with public figures including Keir Starmer and Sadiq Khan attended a memorial service in central London, but not his friend Duwayne Brooks, who was with him when he was attacked. “I was refereeing,” he says matter-of-factly. Like he does every weekend, for his south London football league. Not that Brooks believes the occasion shouldn’t be remembered. “In my opinion it’s got to be marked every year,” he says. “It’s not just the Lawrence family that suffered because of what happened to their son – there are families across Britain who have suffered similar in terms of their children being taken so young.” , Diane and David Rowsell were looking forward to spending more time with the grandchildren. Then they discovered how many of their neighbours in York were going hungry “We fell into it,” says Diane Rowsell, 63, of the community food support project that she and husband David, 64, started in 2020. “It wasn’t like we sat at home thinking: ‘What can we do with our lives now?’” Pre-retirement they were busy: David’s job as a headteacher allowed them to live in the Czech Republic and the US, where Diane, a physiotherapist by training, also worked teaching music; they travelled extensively and adventurously in their free time. Back home in York, they were looking forward to more travel, plus time on their allotment and with their grandchildren. “Just that era of life – busy doing not much!” says Diane. But it doesn’t sound that quiet when she explains that the couple bought a camper van, David was working as a leadership coach, she was taking art classes, and both were volunteering – Diane gardening and David chairing the local school board of governors. Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60? , Alongside the commemorative plates and mugs are some more unusual offerings, from royal ‘pawtraits’ to carriage rides The coronation is rapidly approaching, and with it comes a multitude of companies selling an array of commemorative merchandise to consumers. But alongside what you might expect (a commemorative plate or King Charles mug) are some rather unusual offerings, as some businesses and their PR teams seem to be doing anything possible to mark the day. We’ve done a roundup of the most unexpected coronation merchandise out there, as well as the simply awkward and bizarre. , He was a trail-blazing genius who electrified US ballet. But he was also a dictatorial grudge-bearer who married four of his dancers. How should we remember the Russian-American choreographer? ‘I don’t have a past. I have a continuous present,” said the great Russian-American choreographer George Balanchine, a great believer in forward motion. When Balanchine’s health began to fail, in his mid-70s, he resisted making a will, not thinking that the hundreds of ballets he had created would live on without him. When the IRS posthumously valued his repertory, it decided that the maximum shelf life of even his greatest ballets was just 15 years. Yet today, almost exactly 40 years after Balanchine’s death, his works are as popular as ever. New York City Ballet (NYCB), the company he founded, has just announced its 75th anniversary season, with dozens of performances of his works. Masterful ballets such as Serenade, Symphony in C and Agon are still regularly danced around the world. This summer, the Australian Ballet comes to the UK to perform his Jewels. When Carlos Acosta marks his 50th birthday on stage in July, it is Balanchine’s Apollo that he will dance. , Air pollution and the climate crisis are making pollen even more of a menace. Here’s how to stop your eyes itching and nose streaming If you’ve found yourself reaching for the tissues more than usual recently, you’re not alone. The sun has shown its face a bit, and thanks to the arrival of a tree pollen bomb, which occurs when groups of trees release millions of grains of pollen at the same time, many of us are trading the joys of spring for itchy eyes and streaming noses. According to Margaret Kelman, acting head of clinical services at Allergy UK, the number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years, with the condition now affecting one in four adults in the UK. “Climate change, including increased air pollution, has contributed to more intense pollen seasons,” she says. “Warmer weather speeds up the growing process, causing pollen seasons to start earlier and last longer.” , It’s gripping, nuanced, almost unbearably tense – and it’s about to come to an end. The BBC show’s take on policing post-Troubles Belfast is one of the finest watches of the year When Blue Lights first appeared, it was hard to get too excited about yet another cop show. We are only at the end of April and already the year has been stuffed with them, from the great (Happy Valley) to the functionally decent (Unforgotten) to the fine (Better), you can’t move for a moody detective or a seemingly uncrackable case. One theory about their enduring appeal is that police procedurals are the most psychologically satisfying form of storytelling, because they fulfil what the human brain finds pleasurable about drama – a puzzle to solve, red herrings and false starts, and the idea that somebody knows what’s going on, even if we don’t yet. Written and co-created by Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson (who wrote The Salisbury Poisonings), Blue Lights sets itself apart from the pack. The series – whose final episode airs on BBC One tonight – has a journalistic eye for detail and nuance. It sidesteps the case-of-the-week template, preferring to take an overview of the incredibly complex world of policing in Belfast. This is rich material. First broadcast just before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it paints a detailed picture of the city as it is today, with the Troubles never far from that picture, whether in the highly sensitive issue of policing by consent (and consent is not a given), or in the histories of the men (and women) involved in organised crime. , Scottish-born chef started career in kitchens at the age of 12 before moving to Australia and opening prize-winning restaurants that faltered as mainstream success grew  • Jock Zonfrillo, MasterChef Australia judge and chef, dies aged 46 As a culinary figure, Jock Zonfrillo reached the highest peaks in Australia, his adopted homeland. He won national and international awards, and went on to become a television star with a coveted judging spot on MasterChef. However the life of the chef and television personality, who died on 30 April at age 46, had great lows, both private and public. Zonfrillo, whose legal name is Barry, was raised in Ayr, Scotland. His father, Ivan, was a barber, and his paternal grandparents had migrated to Scotland from Italy, while his mother Sarah’s family were farmers in Scotland. , The site’s success has led to it being accused of swamping tourist hotspots with short-term lets and forcing out locals With its burgeoning, vibrant arts scene, Margate was the perfect base for Dan Thompson, a writer and social activist. But when his landlord came to sell his flat, he was left with nowhere to move to, due to a shortage of properties in the area. One reason, he believes, is that many of the homes are let as short-term rentals on Airbnb. Almost 640 entire homes are let out in the coastal town, according to rental analytics company AirDNA. , We tried and tried, but failed and failed. Yet the fertility industry kept offering us hope, so long as we offered them money Is it possible to become addicted to fertility treatment? When does spending tens of thousands of pounds on IVF with no guarantee that it will actually work become a gambling problem? These are the questions I am searching for answers to as I meet virtually with a doctor from a top London fertility clinic. “Women are a mystery,” he jokes. I smile politely into the tiny camera on my laptop. I had been considering treatment with his clinic and we have spent the last hour running through my history of infertility, or rather, in my case, incomplete fertility. My husband and I have been trying for nine years to have a baby. I’m quite good at getting pregnant, especially when we first started trying, but I can’t seem to stay pregnant. I don’t know why. And as it turns out, neither do the experts. I have spent years seeking their help, and because IVF wasn’t available on the NHS in my area, I have paid thousands of pounds along the way in my relentless pursuit of pregnancy. , The Guardian was right to remove and delete the cartoon published on Saturday, but with all that is known about anti-Jewish symbols and images, this should not be happening Other than his closest friends, it is unlikely that anybody would complain if a Guardian cartoonist drew Boris Johnson as a gorilla. All’s fair in political satire, cartoonists are expected to be scurrilous, and the former prime minister is fair game. But if that same cartoonist drew a black politician in simian form, it would be obviously racist. This is the principle to hold in mind when decoding Martin Rowson’s cartoon of outgoing BBC chair Richard Sharp, who is Jewish, in Saturday’s Guardian. Centuries of anti-Jewish caricaturists (and to be clear, I do not accuse Rowson or the Guardian of falling into this category) have generated an extensive library of visual tropes to convey their hatred of, and disgust for, Jews. This is partly because antisemites face a challenge: how do you incite hatred against a group of people who are not always readily identifiable? Not every Jew wears religious clothing or “looks Jewish” to every beholder. Dr Dave Rich is author of Everyday Hate: How antisemitism is built into our world and how you can change it , There is unease about what happens next. We’re not perfect, but politicians will do anything but address their own shortcomings So, exactly who is making the UK apparently ungovernable? Is it bullying, psychotic ministers intent on stoking the culture wars until Gary Lineker, the BBC, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and every other woke-sucking, electorate-hating public institution is consumed by its righteous flames? Or is it, more specifically, us “over-unionised”, “activist” civil servants – who, despite being a “very small minority” of milquetoast snowflakes, are still somehow capable of orchestrating the ruthless defenestration of Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay and any other poor minister who dares to actually get something – anything – done? , The Harold and Maude actor shows us that spur of the moment acts of generosity can be truly life affirming On the first day directing my first film came my first communication error. I’d asked the costume department to take a man’s shirt (which the lead character had stolen after a one night stand), and fashion it into something she fixes around her cat to stop it picking at its surgical stitches. Expecting it to look like a striped cotton bandage, I was presented with a cat wearing an immaculately tailored miniature button-down. In the end I took it off the cat, but I wish I’d made that work because, when I’ve occasionally daydreamed about the etymology of phrases, I’ve always felt drawn to “the shirt off my back”. At the end of the shoot, my lead, Jemima Kirke, slipped off a diamond and ruby fox ring and handed it to me – the ring off her own finger! I was touched by the gesture and by the echo from a woman I’d cast as “me”: I’d done this same thing myself to friends when I felt they needed moral support, unhooking a bracelet or brooch and pressing it into their palm. It’s never the value of the jewellery that matters as much as the instant decision. Maybe it’s a sense of memory conversation with the ancestors who sewed valuables into their clothes as they fled expulsions, pogroms and ghettoes; letting the past know I feel safe enough in my own life to give my precious things away. I’d say I’ve lost three pieces of jewellery this way, but they’re the opposite of lost. , I have explained what has happened to me, on my own terms, and people have responded in kind I’ve had a double mastectomy. I don’t find it straightforward to spell or to pronounce, but it’s the term I find easiest to use when I tell people what has happened to me. I just can’t put it in plain English, and say exactly what the surgeons did. This may change, but it seems too painful to me, and I worry about the people listening. Generally, since I was diagnosed with breast cancer last summer I have tried to avoid couching things in terms that may be unclear. Years of writing articles on complicated financial products and schemes in my roles on the Guardian’s Money and Investigations desks have conditioned me to avoid jargon. I like to get to the point and use language that is accessible, rather than words that exclude people, and in the main I have taken this approach to my illness. Hilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editor , The president is trying to appeal to climate-conscious young voters and appease the fossil fuel industry. It won’t work Just before announcing that he would again run for president, Joe Biden signed off on what on the surface looks like a great move to help address the climate crisis: an executive order that creates an office of environmental justice in the White House. “Environmental justice,” the president said from the Rose Garden, “will be the mission of the entire government, woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments.” That is a beautiful sentiment. And sentiment, when coupled with substantive policy positions, can lead the country forward. The idea of a White House office that can help mobilize an all-of-government response to the climate crisis could be a force multiplier in the fight to save the planet. But to be effective it needs real presidential leadership that involves the creation of a bold and realistic plan to phase out fossil fuels along a strict timeline. Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer, a Guardian US columnist, and the creator of the Substack newsletter Donziger on Justice , Unsuccessful US college applicants have started having cathartic parties to ‘celebrate’. I think they might be on to something High school students in the US are tackling the brutal process of college applications with rejection parties, the New York Times reported last week. At one school, students bring along a printout of their college rejections, ceremonially feed them into a shredder, then get an ice-cream; there is a prize for the most rejected. It sounds wonderful: a cathartic, collective “screw you” to a broken system, using fun to salve the pain. I wonder if owning rejection is easier in the US, where there is at least a partial sense that failure is OK; it’s considered a learning opportunity and a key part of the origin story. The Silicon Valley motto “fail fast, fail often” took hold because failure was seen as indicative of audacity and a willingness to try. Rejection is a particularly stinging subset of failure, but the principle remains: you took the shot; it didn’t pay off; you try again. , Harry Kane faces big decision, Palace are throwback entertainers and Gary O’Neil shows humility amid success Jack Grealish has stopped falling over. But it’s not just that. Grealish was fouled just twice against Fulham, neither of these the contact-seeking lunges that had for a while become a part of his game. Grealish isn’t necessarily cheating or diving when he does this. The take-the-foul routine is also a way of having your legs battered into a pulp over several years. Grealish carries the ball too well not to be tripped a lot. Contact will happen. Why not manage how that collision works, take the lightest of touches, fall well? But Grealish has started to stay up as well, to use his strength instead to terrorise and bully defenders. He was very good against Fulham, helping to make the opening goal, and just about surviving an ongoing battle with Kenny Tete, who was defending aggressively. Another thing here: the Fulham crowd barracked Grealish and he wagged his finger back at them. But the feeling was less outrage, more pantomime jeers, a kind of semi-buried respect. The other story of Grealish’s season is that he is now surely the most marketable English player in the league; and, grudgingly perhaps for some, one of the most likeable. Barney Ronay Match report: Fulham 1-2 Manchester City Match report: Liverpool 4-3 Tottenham Match report: Manchester United 1-0 Aston Villa , BBC broadcaster is synonymous with the event after more than 20 years as TV’s face of the world snooker championship This year’s World Snooker Championship has produced what some fans of the sport would consider a long overdue wind of change on the baize. Sure, Mark Selby can cement his place in history on bank holiday Monday if he wins the title for a fifth time, but the sight of two players under the age of 30 in Luca Brecel and Si Jiahui playing out a world semi-final felt refreshing if nothing else, given how the sport has been dominated by the same clutch of players for so long. Sports thrive on progression and evolution when it comes to the stars of the show – but away from the action, consistency is a valuable commodity. And for all the change snooker is trying to undergo, there is one bastion of consistency who perhaps never quite gets the credit they truly deserve. In an ever-changing world, nothing screams comforting reassurance like Hazel Irvine presenting the snooker on the BBC. She will utter the first words to the new champion of the world on Monday evening and these days anyone other than Irvine on hand for the biggest moments that matter in snooker feels wrong. , Refreshing response to a question from the media was unlike much of the discourse surrounding elite professional sport Almost certainly fed up while facing the press in the media centre of Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum last Wednesday night, Giannis Antetokounmpo made no attempt to disguise his utter contempt for the query he had just been asked to field. The Bucks basketball legend had fronted up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate after his team’s elimination by the lowly ranked Miami Heat after a five-game series, arguably one of the most seismic upsets in NBA playoff history. Antetokounmpo’s gaze was caught by Eric Nehm, the man from the Athletic on the Bucks beat, who kept his question fairly short and to the point. He had already asked it of Antetokounmpo’s coach and now wished to hear the player’s considered opinion. “Do you view this season as a failure?” A protracted sigh from the top table was followed by an audible groan of “Oh my God”, as Antetokounmpo wearily rubbed his hands up his face and through his hair, in the manner of a man who can’t quite believe the absolute inanity of the question he’s just been asked. Countering with several of his own, rhetorical questions regarding the successes or failures his inquisitor might have enjoyed or endured in his professional life over the past 12 months, he proceeded to expound on his own idea of what constitutes failure, or if there’s even any such thing. “Michael Jordan played 15 years,” he said. “Won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That’s what you’re telling me? I’m asking you a question, yes or no?” , Time will tell who got the best haul of players in Kansas City this year but the already formidable Philly look like they aced the draft once again Philadelphia Eagles. In the past two seasons, the Eagles have given masterclasses in how to execute a perfect draft. The reigning NFC champions have found gold in the south by selecting top-tier players from college football’s best defense. In last year’s draft, the Eagles selected two dominant defensive players, Jordan Davis and Nakobe Dean, both of whom helped the Georgia Bulldogs capture the 2022 national championship. , Project hopes Beatles classic will ‘unite the world’ and show victims of the conflict that they’ll never walk alone An ambitious campaign to create the world’s biggest sing-along as an expression of solidarity with Ukraine during the Eurovision song contest is gaining momentum. The #HelpUkraineSong project is aiming to “unite the world through music” by getting as many people as possible to sing the Beatles’ With a Little Help from My Friends at noon on Saturday 13 May. , Children’s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, urges first minister to put UN protections for under-18s into law Scotland’s outgoing children’s commissioner has warned Humza Yousaf that it will be his “personal failure” if he fails to make good on Nicola Sturgeon’s promise to put international children’s rights standards at the heart of Scottish law. In one of his final interviews before he steps down from the role after six years, Bruce Adamson accused Scottish ministers of “heartbreaking” delays, lack of transparency and “constant broken promises”, after the supreme court ruled that initial attempts at incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law went beyond Holyrood’s powers. , Study of 200,000 Chinese hospital admissions finds acute exposure to air pollution raises risk of heart arrhythmias Spikes in air pollution increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, a large study has found. The research, based on nearly 200,000 hospital admissions in China, found a significant increase in risk of arrhythmias in the first few hours after an increase in air pollution levels. Heart arrhythmias can increase the risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death. , Investors claim sportswear giant failed to minimise their exposure to risk after the rapper and designer’s antisemitic comments led to a sharp decline in the share price Adidas shareholders have filed a class action lawsuit against the sportswear brand, claiming it knew about Kanye West’s problematic behaviour years before it ended their partnership over his antisemitic comments. The shareholders also allege that Adidas failed to mitigate their financial losses or take precautionary measures to minimise their exposure, after the designer and rapper’s erratic behaviour and offensive comments saw him and his Yeezy brand dropped by Adidas, which resulted in a sharp decline in the company’s stock. , Participants who turned in guns were given up to $500 for each firearm at nine program locations throughout the state Thousands of guns were surrendered across New York on Saturday in exchange for gift cards as part of the state’s gun buyback program. According to the New York attorney general, Letitia James, whose office organized the event, more than 3,000 guns including various assault-style rifles and “ghost guns” were given up in what she hailed as a “landmark event”. , Despite the pain of the condition, diagnoses take seven years on average globally. In India, where 42 million women have the disease, cultural stigmas can make the delay even longer ‘Hell-on-earth excruciating pain,” is how Ruhi Singh* describes her experience of endometriosis. Yet it took nearly 20 doctors more than 10 years for her to get a diagnosis. “I got an ultrasound every month where they told me it was all clear and I should ‘do yoga’ or ‘get pregnant’,” says Singh. “I have a bone to pick with all of those doctors.” Her experience is not unusual. Globally, it takes seven years on average to get a diagnosis, even though endometriosis is as common as diabetes, affecting one in 10 women. , Wall Street stalwart to buy ‘all deposits and substantially all assets’ of collapsed bank in deal brokered by federal regulators JP Morgan is to acquire most of the collapsing California bank First Republic, in a takeover brokered by regulators as the US races to contain a rash of bank failures with echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis. After weekend talks brokered by regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. , Santiago Peña of the Colorado party is elected, defeating Efraín Alegre who wanted to switch diplomatic recognition to China Paraguay’s ruling party candidate, Santiago Peña, 44, has scored a big win in the presidential election, tightening the conservative Colorado party’s political grip and defusing fears that diplomatic ties with Taiwan might have been cut. Peña, who has pledged to maintain Paraguay’s longstanding Taiwan relations, had 42.7% of the vote with more than 99% of ballots counted – a more than 15-point lead over centre-left rival Efraín Alegre, who has argued for switching allegiance to China. , Ahead of King Charles III’s coronation, prime minister voices support for separating from monarchy but says it is not a priority New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has said he supports the country becoming a republic but has no immediate plans to act on separation from the monarchy. Hipkins was holding a press conference hours before departing to attend King Charles III’s coronation, when he was asked about the prospect of New Zealand’s independence from the crown. , Reporters say even seemingly innocuous stories are putting them at risk of assault, intimidation and police action under the Digital Security Act Four weeks ago, a reporter in Bangladesh was hauled from his office, badly beaten - and then thrown from the roof of his building, leaving him with fractures in his back, three broken ribs and a machete wound on his head. The journalist, Ayub Meahzi, believes he was targeted for reporting on alleged local government ties to a criminal group. The attack in Chattogram, south-east Bangladesh, has compounded fears of a deterioration in press freedom in the country, which languishes near the bottom of a global press freedom index due to be updated later this week by the group Reporters Sans Frontières. , Over the years, female artists like Georgia O’Keeffe and Hilma af Klint have received scathing reviews. When will women stop being seen as easy targets? In 1993, the reviews for Georgia O’Keeffe’s exhibition at London’s Hayward gallery came in. In the Independent, Andrew Graham-Dixon likened the American artist to a “commercial illustrator” who had “limited talents … but the ambition to be remembered as a Rembrandt”. The Evening Standard’s Brian Sewell said her works were “irredeemably amateur”. William Feaver of the Observer proclaimed that her paintings “made good monthly images on calendars”, while Hilton Kramer’s review in the Sunday Telegraph called her “grossly overrated”, adding that “her great personal beauty played a major role in the myth that now attaches to her name”. Many of these comments are quoted in an article by Beatrix Campbell, published in the Independent in 1993, with the headline: A Woman’s Art That Men Refuse to See. Campbell argued for a more intellectual reading of O’Keeffe – complaining that “national newspaper art critics do not think it necessary to explain or empathise with … or to locate her in the history of American modernism”. This made me think about how so much art criticism is written from a male point of view, and the exceedingly wide gender imbalance that still exists within it. , Our roundup of drama to watch at home includes Panti Bliss’s drag journey, Athol Fugard’s ballroom dreamers and Alain Platel’s nightmarish dance-theatre How very! The sour bubblegum musical inspired by the cult 80s teen movie was filmed during its residency at London’s Other Palace, where they offer karaoke nights and “freeze your brain” cocktails. Make your own slushie and sing along on the sofa as Veronica and JD do some damage. On Icon Film Channel. , The actor’s tale about the creation of a fantasy film captures the humdrum of Hollywood but lacks his on-screen ability to breathe life into characters There is probably a good reason why it is hard to compile a list of decent novels about the making of films (I can think of one, Terry Southern’s Blue Movie): nothing much happens. Or as Tom Hanks observes in this ambitious addition to the genre: “making movies is complicated, maddening, highly technical at times”. Reading it is to be reminded that Hanks, one of the greatest of all movie stars, must have had a good deal of time on his hands during lockdown. Part of its motivation appears to be to give a proper flavour of that truism of movie making: that so much of it is waiting around; three days sitting in a trailer for a minute or two of drama that might end up in a digital suite trash can. This novel, if nothing else, gives you a sense of that experience in real time. Hanks, a famous collector of typewriters, has put them to use once before, in a short story collection that came out in 2017. On that occasion his publisher ventured that “the two-time Oscar winner is as talented a writer as he is an actor”. His screen agent might have had something to say. He writes well enough – there are many artfully constructed scenes here – and what he doesn’t know about the world of this book you’d imagine is not worth knowing; but that quality that he possesses in so much range and depth on screen – the ability to make you care deeply about lives not your own – is quite often elusive on the page. , ...]</td>\n",

at a Barcelona restaurant were left amazed when a mysterious last-minute booking turned out to be for the former US president Barack Obama along with film director Steven Spielberg and singer Bruce Springsteen. After dining on Thursday evening at the Palace Hotel’s Amar restaurant, the trio posed for a photograph with employees. The picture was posted on Instagram by staff member Pol Perello and captioned: “Pleasures that this job brings you!!” ,  Qatari banker offers around £5bn for 100% of club Interested parties needed to make offers by 10pm BST on Friday Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have lodged final bids for Manchester United by Friday’s 10pm BST deadline. The offers are markedly less than the £6bn valuation of the club’s owners, the Glazers. Sheikh Jassim, a Qatari banker, remains intent on purchasing 100% of the club but will not pay more than what he believes United are worth. The Guardian understands this is around £5bn, roughly £1bn below the American family’s asking price. ,  Si leads 14-10 after one of the best sessions ever seen Mark Selby leads Mark Allen 7-6 in gruelling semi-final Luca Brecel staged a brave fightback to stay in his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Si Jiahui in one of the most exciting sessions witnessed at the Crucible. The Chinese world No 80, who has wowed fans over the last two weeks with his brilliant attacking game, looked on course to win the match with a session to spare when he won the first three frames of the evening session, extending his lead from 11-5 to 14-5 with breaks of 90, 132 and 97. ,  Bochum 1-1 Borussia Dortmund Bayern Munich will go top if they beat Hertha Berlin on Sunday The Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund’s title chances suffered a serious blow on Friday after they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at struggling Bochum. Dortmund are on 61 points with four matches remaining, two points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich, who will move top if they beat bottom club Hertha Berlin on Sunday. , Colombian author’s En Agosto Now Vemos (We’ll See Each Other in August) had been just a rumour but now fans will get to read it Rumours had long circulated that an entire literary masterpiece, never seen by the public, could still be lying in a dusty safe held by the late author’s family or under lock and key at his archive at the University of Texas. On Friday Penguin Random House confirmed that an unpublished Gabriel García Márquez novel – titled En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We’ll See Each Other in August) – not only exists, but will be on shelves across Latin America in 2024. , Tree design includes names of Commonwealth nations, and poles are made from tree from Windsor estate The king and the queen consort will be anointed behind a specially created screen of fine embroidery, held by poles hewn from an ancient windblown Windsor oak and mounted with eagles cast in bronze and gilded in gold leaf, Buckingham Palace has announced. The anointing screen has been blessed at a special service at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, and will be used at what historically has been viewed as the most sacred moment of the coronation. , Wikimedia UK says it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill Wikipedia could be made inaccessible to UK readers due to issues over complying with the online safety bill, a charity affiliated with the website has warned. Lucy Crompton-Reid, the chief executive of Wikimedia UK, warned the popular site could be blocked because it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill. , Scotland’s Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has been asked to look into the killing of Glasgow teacher  Scotland’s police watchdog has been ordered to launch an investigation into the murder of a pregnant teacher in Glasgow after finding the body of her fiance in a reservoir days later. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said it had been instructed to carry out the probe after the death of Marelle Sturrock, who was found at her home on Tuesday. , The former striker discusses visiting hospitals in his homeland, his push to raise funds and Champions League hopes for Milan “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. , Forty-year-old festival sees chefs use power tools to mix the eggs before a fork lift hoists the enormous frying pan into place Using 8,400 eggs, 25kg of venison sausage and 14 bottles of salt and pepper, New Caledonia’s giant omelette festival aims to bring people together in a region that is often divided. “It is important to have festivals like this. The giant omelette is a symbol of sharing,” says veteran chef Reine Chenot. , Twickenham is expected to host over 53,000 fans as England’s departing head coach aims to end with glory against France After eight years, 85 Tests, 76 wins and 3,411 points scored, England’s head coach Simon Middleton takes charge of his final match on Saturday. It should be quite a finale, with a world-record crowd for a women’s game in excess of 53,000 expected at Twickenham as the Red Roses go head-to-head with France in a winner-takes-all Six Nations decider. The record currently stands at 42,579, set at the World Cup final at Eden Park in November. The attendance is also sure to smash the current Women’s Six Nations record, set last weekend with 18,604 watching France v Wales at the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. , In the best traditions of Fergie-time, substitute Millie Turner headed home the latest possible winning goal to help Manchester United stretch their lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to six points. The centre-back converted Katie Zelem’s much-disputed free-kick three minutes into added time to keep United’s dreams of a league and FA Cup double alive. , Different reports fly around while Fox News declines to comment on the cancellation of top TV host’s show The exact reason behind the rightwing TV host Tucker Carlson’s abrupt firing from Fox News remains unclear, days after the star’s show was suddenly cancelled. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Carlson was fired after executives discovered vulgar text messages, including one in which he called a top executive the C-word. There were also concerns among Fox management that Carlson was acting as if he was above the network, the Journal reported. , UN’s arbitrary detention group calls for immediate release of Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, saying detention has no basis in law A UN body has declared that the detention of a long-term Guantánamo inmate, Abu Zubaydah, has no lawful basis and called for his immediate release, warning that the systemic deprivation of liberty at the camp may “constitute crimes against humanity”. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD), also declared the UK, among other countries, was “jointly responsible for the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of Mr Zubaydah” over his more than 20 years in detention. , US supreme court justice, who wrote Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, denies claims he was responsible for leak in draft form Samuel Alito said the decision he wrote removing the federal right to abortion made him and other US supreme court justices “targets of assassination” but denied claims he was responsible for its leak in draft form. “Those of us who were thought to be in the majority, thought to have approved my draft opinion, were really targets of assassination,” Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. , Yemeni authorities said ‘suspicious’ and unresponsive ship opened fire, while ship manager reports clash with pirates Armed guards aboard a yacht once owned by the late Welsh actor Richard Burton have fired on approaching ships in the Gulf of Aden, prompting an intense gunfight. Yemeni authorities said the guards mistakenly opened fire on a Coast Guard vessel but the ship’s manager insisted they had clashed with pirates. The shooting reportedly killed one Yemeni Coast Guard member and wounded another person in a hail of gunfire – the guards are said to have shot as many as 200 rounds of ammunition. The incident shows the danger faced by both shippers and security forces in the waters off the Arab world’s poorest country, even as it remains crucial for global commerce. , Crowning of King Charles expected to pass quietly in New Zealand, though there is still some fascination with the crown In town halls and social media groups, New Zealand’s most committed royalists are planning high teas, concerts, and watching parties. For the most dedicated, the memorabilia will be out on display: tea sets and replica tiaras, lifetime collections of Woman’s Weekly front pages and special edition photo books. For others, however – including some of the country’s dedicated royal watchers – the coronation cupcakes and cucumber sandwiches come with a side of doubt, over the future of the monarchy and the changing way that it is viewed in colonised countries. Elizabeth Garlick will watch the coronation live, late into the night, with a group of other royal fans who are planning wine, cheese, and possibly tiaras. She says she fell in love with the royals as a small child, seeing princess Diana in the news, and over time became a “royal watcher” – keeping track of major events in the monarchy’s timeline. “I grew up in a family of other royal watchers – my great aunties, my great nana has [the queen’s] coronation on vinyl,” she says. “For me, this is like a once in a lifetime – a historical moment.” , Evacuations from Sudan, battle raging in Bakhmut, protests against a judicial overhaul in Israel and climate activism in Berlin: the most striking images this week , Government announces end to airlifts amid calls for NHS doctors without UK passports to be rescued British nationals trapped in Sudan have until midday on Saturday local time to get on a flight before they stop, ministers have announced, as a doctors’ union called for NHS medics without UK passports to also be airlifted. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Friday night more than 1,500 people had been flown out, and there had been a “significant decline in British nationals coming forward”, meaning it was time to end the operation. , Four main teaching unions could unite after ‘months of stonewalling’ from education secretary Gillian Keegan All state schools in England could be closed by “unprecedented” coordinated strikes involving all four teaching unions, after their leaders vowed to increase pressure on the government to improve its pay offer. In a joint press conference, the leaders of the four major education unions said they wanted to send a message to the education secretary that she needed to resume negotiations over pay and school funding. , The Conservative party has been too involved in the debasement of public life for too long to be entrusted with its rehabilitation The advertisement for the job of BBC chair for which Richard Sharp successfully applied in November 2020, and from which he resigned on Friday, stipulated that candidates declare any “real or perceived conflict of interest”. Care should be taken over issues that could “be misconstrued, cause embarrassment, or cause public confidence in the appointment to be jeopardised”. One such issue, in Mr Sharp’s case, was helping facilitate guarantees for a personal loan of up to £800,000 from a Canadian financier to Boris Johnson, then prime minister. When asked by the advisory assessment panel that gave the green light for his appointment about perceived conflicts of interest, Mr Sharp said everything had been properly declared. It had not. A report into the process, published on Friday, found that omission to be an unambiguous breach of the rules. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. , Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach has declared that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, has said that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings. But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration. Mr Loach is 86 and Mr Auerbach is 92 on Saturday, and they are still working. For all the challenges of age that both report, they continue to command the heights of their respective vocations – as does another great 92-year‑old artist Bridget Riley, who is about to unveil her first ceiling painting at the British School in Rome. , Conservative party accused of undermining broadcaster by flooding it with cronies after chair’s resignation Rishi Sunak is under pressure to stop appointing Conservatives to key positions at the BBC after Richard Sharp’s resignation prompted criticism the party had undermined the broadcaster by flooding it with cronies. Sharp quit as BBC chair on Friday morning after an investigation concluded he had failed to disclose key information about his relationship with the former prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job in 2021. Sharp helped facilitate an £800,000 loan guarantee for Johnson when he was in the running to take over the broadcaster but did not tell the appointments panel. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter and child cruelty by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , Record heat in southern Europe and chilly start to British growing season spell more misery for shoppers Shoppers have been warned they face more fruit and vegetable shortages, as temperatures in southern Spain soar to unprecedented levels while the UK growing season gets off to a late start because of cold, overcast weather. Temperatures were expected to reach a new April record of 39C (102F) in parts of Andalucía on Friday amid a long-lasting drought that has affected the production of vegetables in Spain. Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday. , Submarine rescue vessel SS-750 was photographed in Baltic four days before still-unexplained explosions, says Danish newspaper A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just prior to the mysterious September blasts, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage confirmed the existence of the hitherto publicly unknown photographs. , South African magnate hopes there will be bidder in auction who prefers 1,993 rare creatures to a superyacht Wanted: an animal-loving billionaire who might consider buying 1,993 threatened white rhinos instead of a new superyacht or a Picasso, or a Picasso onboard a superyacht. John Hume, a South African multimillionaire who started a rhino breeding project with about 200 animals 30 years ago, is selling all the rhinos and the 8,500-hectare (21,000 acres) conservation ranch where they live in what must rank as one of the most unusual ever online auctions. , Council’s preparations are under way but excitement is muted and some say they are unlikely to watch Chris Booth spent much of Tuesday morning supervising the installation of a crown 4.2 metres wide on the stone columns at the front of Nottingham’s Council House. The crown had been brought out of a council depot (where it is stored alongside a vast goose that appears annually for the Nottingham goose fair), repainted and had had its plastic pearls retrofitted with LED bulbs so they can be lit up at night. , Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets. Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in Avengers: Infinity War but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone). , Current science suggests that chrono-activity or adjusting our regimes to suit our body clocks, plus short, sharp workouts, are the key to a beneficial exercise routine Thousands of us have started 2023 with new exercise programmes promising to get us fit, muscle-bound and slim. But the latest science of chrono-exercise (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it. Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym. ,  Max Verstappen will start second on grid for Sunday’s race Hamilton fifth but Russell 11th after disappointing Q2 After a frustrating and stultifying opening to the new Formula One season, Ferrari finally have a moment to savour. How much it meant was clear as Charles Leclerc climbed from his car having taken pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and vigorously pointed to the prancing horse logo on his chest. Pumped by an immaculate performance, he and the Scuderia will view this as the belated opening to 2023 they wanted – but what follows this weekend will more accurately define the scale of their challenge to a dominant Red Bull. Leclerc has taken a battering in the opening three races. He suffered an engine failure in Bahrain, a 10-place grid penalty in Saudi Arabia and was unlucky to be punted out of the race on the first lap in Australia. After a week in which he has had to dismiss rumours of talks with Mercedes to join the team should Lewis Hamilton retire, and in which it was announced that Ferrari’s racing director, Laurent Mekies, is to leave to replace Franz Tost as team principal at AlphaTauri – a blow after the recent loss of technical director David Sanchez to McLaren – Leclerc delivered reason for the embattled team to finally breathe out. ,  Former England captain was strategic adviser to the ECB T20 could have two divisions and 18 teams Andrew Strauss has left his roles as strategic adviser to the England and Wales Cricket Board and chair of the performance cricket committee only three weeks after the changes to the structure of domestic cricket he recommended in last year’s high performance review were declared “dead in the water” by Richard Gould, the governing body’s chief executive. The announcement came on the day it emerged that the men’s Hundred could be abandoned in favour of a new Twenty20 competition, with the ECB said to be concerned the new format has failed to catch on internationally and was not as appealing to the cream of international talent as the widely played alternative. ,  French Open finalist’s struggles continue on clay ATP announces live electronic line calling across Tour One of the greatest challenges of being a top tennis player is remaining one, year after year, even as the rest of the field conspires to tear you down. In the first few months of his sophomore season among the elite, Casper Ruud continues to exemplify that struggle. Ruud, the French Open runner up last year, suffered another early loss on clay, losing 6-3, 6-4 to young Italian Matteo Arnaldi in the second round of the Madrid Open. A year ago, Ruud had reached the fourth round of a grand slam only once. Although he was already a top 10 player, he had a reputation for specialising in clay and thriving in the smaller events. The Norwegian blew every expectation out of the water in his breakthrough season, reaching finals at the French Open, US Open, ATP Finals and Miami Open. A match away from the top spot in New York, he finished the season having reached a career high ranking of No 2. , This debacle brought together a foolish man and a dishonest prime minister, but it also highlights the urgent need for systemic reform A word of advice for anyone who has worked hard to acquire a reputation they cherish: if Boris Johnson approaches, if he comes anywhere near, run a mile. Richard Sharp is the latest proof that, even out of office, Johnson continues to act as reputational napalm, laying waste to careers and turning good names bad. Sharp joins a long list that includes Christopher Geidt, who had the poison task of serving as Johnson’s adviser on ethics; Allegra Stratton, whom the former prime minister said had “sickened” him when she joked about a party in Downing Street, even though he had attended several himself; and the one-time rising star civil servant and current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, quoted this week as having said of Johnson, “I don’t know what more I can do to stand up to a prime minister who lies”. Each entered Johnson’s circle as a respected figure; each was diminished by their contact with the reverse Midas, the man who rots everything he touches. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist , Readers respond to Emma Beddington’s article about the embarrassment she felt at the state of the country when her French in-laws came to visit Emma Beddington writes about being embarrassed by the state of Britain when her French in-laws visited, citing various ways in which the country compares poorly with France (I saw the UK through the eyes of my French in-laws – and it was deeply embarrassing, 23 April). But she ends on a positive note, describing how her in-laws were impressed on a train when they saw “a lovely group of women sitting next to us in Hawaiian garlands, enjoying prosecco at 8am”. If that is the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s not much. I can understand Beddington’s “countrybarrassment”. Especially because there is no other country I have been so much in love with as Britain. For some 60 years, I travelled its length and breath, reading its literature, enjoying its arts. Its people were always welcoming – at least, that is what I thought, and I still think that most of the time the friendliness is sincere. , Readers lament the damage to culture resulting from the government cutting funding Sir Simon Rattle is right to voice his anxiety about the state of classical music in the UK (Simon Rattle is right: Britain is becoming a cultural desert – and that’s a political choice, 26 April). He is concerned for the future of orchestras, opera houses and large choirs as public financial subsidies dry up. I am the secretary of a very small concert-promoting society in north Hertfordshire. We too have lost local authority support, but even more concerning is the diminishing size of our audiences. , Garden charity no longer categorises slugs and snails as pests but sells items that harm them, say critics The Royal Horticultural Society has been criticised for continuing to sell products that kill wildflowers and insects, despite public messaging about protecting biodiversity. Last year, the RHS said slugs and snails would no longer be classed as pests. The leading garden charity said they were an important part of the garden ecosystem and “play an important role in planet-friendly gardening”. , Vaughn Dolphin, from Walsall, West Midlands, had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot A far-right extremist who accidentally set off a “fireball” in his own kitchen while experimenting with explosives has been convicted of terrorism offences. Vaughn Dolphin, who had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot, was found guilty on a series of charges after a jury viewed videos and incriminating conversations on social media. , With dwindling real-terms pay still a sore point, Whitehall staff feel the  Raab bullying case has only unleashed more hostility “Almost every civil servant I talk to is looking for a way out,” says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now an expert on Whitehall. It’s hardly a surprise after the past few years: civil servants have been demonised as workshy by former Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, blamed for the Partygate scandal by Boris Johnson and threatened with 91,000 job cuts. , Decision welcomed by victim after judge decided not to jail Sean Hogg from South Lanarkshire for the offence A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , Upmarket homewares and clothing retailer sees pretax profits rise 18% in post-lockdown recovery The family behind The White Company have given themselves at least £50m in payments as the upmarket homewares and clothing brand bounces back from the pandemic lockdowns. The company paid a £50m dividend to an entity controlled by the founder, Chrissie Rucker, and her husband, Nicholas Wheeler, the founder of the shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt. The group’s highest paid director, thought to be Rucker, took a further £5m in pay, up from £675,000 a year before, as a long-term bonus plan cashed in. , Woman and child die in Dnipro, while missile strikes in Uman, south of Kyiv, kill 19  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 19 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. , Nation’s guidelines say no donor should father more than 25 children in 12 families Dutch judges have ordered a man suspected of fathering more than 550 children through sperm donations to stop donating, in the latest fertility scandal to shock the Netherlands. The man, identified in Dutch media only as Jonathan M, 41, was taken to court by a foundation protecting the rights of donor children and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. , Rapporteurs also chastise the German and Namibian governments for excluding Herero and Nama minorities from talks dealing with the mass murder of their ancestors UN special rapporteurs have criticised the German and Namibian governments for violating the rights of Herero and Nama ethnic minorities by excluding them from talks over reparations for colonial crimes against their ancestors. Publishing their communication with both governments, the seven UN representatives urged Germany to take responsibility for all its colonial crimes in Namibia – including mass murder – and said it was wrong for the Herero and Nama to have been involved indirectly in talks via an advisory committee. They called on Germany to pay reparations directly to the Herero and Nama and not to the Namibian government. , Ricot Jean found dead after reportedly being kidnapped and Dumesky Kersaint reportedly killed by a stray bullet Two more journalists have been killed in Haiti in the past month as rampant gang violence has gripped the capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Ricot Jean, who worked for Radio-Tele Evolution Inter was found dead on Tuesday, a day after he was reportedly kidnapped by men wearing police uniforms. Jean was a prominent cultural activist in the Haitian capital and hosted a weekly radio show. , Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandalsFor the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films. This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other. , The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work • James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599 Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”. In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.” , Authors, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month. Join the conversation in the comments In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they have been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a memoir that wrestles with singleness, poetry that feels alive and excellent audiobooks. Tell us in the comments what you have been reading. *** , A lager-and-lime slushie (with orange and lemon) that’s very popular in south-east Asia Jelly beer is a popular Thai alcoholic slushie that’s made in a bia wun (oscillating) machine that’s filled with ice, salt, water and beer bottles and that rocks constantly as it cools the beer – usually Singha or Chang – down to -3C. The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added. This ginger, honey and citrus take on the idea involves a blender rather than a bia wun, and uses orange and lime juice instead of the more traditional calamansi juice. It’s a great refreshing drink to welcome the first warm days of spring – and to keep up your sleeve for the hotter months to come. Luke Farrell, Speedboat Bar, London W1 , On her travels Petrina Darrah would often send her mother photographs, then receive a picture of the same place three decades earlier in return  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email When I told my mum I was taking my younger sister to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she could barely contain her excitement. Thirty years before we set foot in Goma, our mother arrived in the same city on a dusty Bedford truck that had carted a swag of lanky youths all the way from London. Back then, the DRC was called Zaire and civil war had yet to tear the region apart. Mum remembers Goma as being quite cosmopolitan. , Fox News settlement seen as ‘moment of weakness’ that puts focus on  mogul’s heirs and their future “Rupert has shown a rare sign of weakness,” says one longtime Murdoch watcher. “There is something of the smell of blood in the water.” In the space of two weeks the 92-year-old’s media empire has taken a reputational hammering on both sides of the Atlantic, putting a renewed focus on the future shape of the global conglomerate’s businesses – and who will run them. , At Omdurman’s open-air market, half of the stalls are shut, customers are scarce and money is tight “I haven’t sold anything since 6am today,” said Adam Musa, a vegetable seller at Omdurman’s open-air market, as fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces raged a few miles away. “There are no people buying.” Musa, 55, faced two problems: a lack of customers, and an inability on the part of those who did come to pay what he was charging. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine.

In the end the Welsh side prevailed, to the relief of their fans and Hollywood owners, consigning Notts County to the playoffs. In National League South, Ebbsfleet had no need to look over their shoulder as they hit the 100-point mark with one game remaining. The Kent side secured the title with four games to spare and sit 18 points clear of their nearest rivals, Dartford. Ebbsfleet’s march to promotion was masterminded by Dennis Kutrieb, a highly regarded young German who took over at the Stonebridge Road in June 2020, three months after the National League season was halted by the pandemic. Ebbsfleet were relegated by 0.002 of a point when clubs agreed to end the season on a points-per-game basis but have finally booked their return to the fifth tier. , The selection attempts to become only the second horse to follow up a Scottish Grand National victory at Sandown Kitty’s Light would be a hugely popular winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup on Jumps Finale day at Sandown on Saturday, and Christian Williams, his trainer, believes the seven-year-old has the right attitude and constitution to follow up his success in the Scottish Grand National last weekend. “He’s freakish for a horse,” Williams said this week. “The way he comes out of his races, you’ll never have seen anything like it. Basically, you could nearly run him in the next race as he recovers so quickly, so there’s something inside him. I’m not sure if he’s got big lungs or a big heart but there’s something in him that’s different to any other horses that we’ve run.” ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email A Tennesee lawmaker who was previously outsted for calling for gun control after a Nashville mass shooting has spoken about Zephyr being silenced. In an interview with Democracy Now, Tennessee representative Justin Jones spoke with Zephyr about the need for continued solidarity. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , PM tells Scottish Tory conference that Holyrood should instead be ‘held to account’ for not using existing powers enough Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Its producer Aaron Dessner explains how they made it For Ed Sheeran, the release of a new album usually means a confident sweep to No 1 and steady dominance of the Top 40 over the subsequent months. But there is more at stake than usual for the 32-year-old songwriter when he releases his fifth album, – (Subtract), next Friday (5 May). The record documents a series of events last spring that Sheeran has characterised as the most challenging period in his life. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a tumour that couldn’t be operated on until after the birth of their second child. His best friend, music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, died aged 31 after taking cocaine. Sheeran was also subject to a high-profile UK court case in which he faced claims he had copied a pair of songwriters’ work in his 2017 smash hit single Shape of You. , New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff. The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT announced fresh action. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp.

I recommend baking them in heavily buttered muffin tins or silicone moulds; baker Julia Aden recently recommended putting a round piece of greaseproof paper in the base of each mould to help remove small cakes, and it works a treat. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Their justification? That Zephyr’s interaction with protesters who were demonstrating against her earlier silencing by the House’s Republican majority amounted to “encouraging an insurrection.” The Associated Press reports that such claims have become increasingly common in recent months in state legislatures where Republicans rule. Case in point, the rhetoric used by GOP lawmakers to briefly expel two Democrats from the Tennessee state House of Representatives earlier this month. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing.

On three different days last summer, visitors at a beach on the lake discovered skeletal remains along the shoreline. The Clark county coroner’s office announced on Thursday that those remains belonged to the same person, now identified as as Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on 14 July 1998 at the age of 52. , Former England captain talks about his ‘tiring’ condition in Netflix series about his life and career  What are typical symptoms and treatments for OCD?

The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong.

His Paris catwalks featured a supermarket selling Coco “Chanel” Pops, a replica Eiffel tower and a spaceship which blasted from the ground in a blaze of smoke.

You have your own losses – and young children – to deal with I am a woman in my late 30s, married with two small children with a rewarding and demanding career. I live some hours’ drive away from where I grew up and where my mum lives. I really love my life   but I need some advice regarding my relationship with my mum. My lovely dad died last year.  He was much loved and I miss him a great deal, but he gave me so much over his lifetime that I am doing OK without him. My family has probably had more loss than most. One sister died before I was born, and another older sister in her early 30s. My mum has called the loss of my dad the hardest of all. I love her very much but I feel responsible for her and guilty that I live far away.  , On his show Carlson railed against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and apologized for Putinist aggression. None of it is new Fox News has finally broken ties with its most popular star, Tucker Carlson. His ousting has been bemoaned by some commentators, who have taken Carlson to be a rebellious anti-war populist, evading easy political characterization. But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology? In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a pro-Russia monologue urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the real enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States. … It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence. , Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have both been accused of ethics violations – and John Roberts refuses to discuss the matter with Congress It was a short letter. John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, was brief in his missive to Democratic senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence”, Roberts declined to appear before the committee to discuss disturbing recent revelations of ethics violations at the court. Congress is meant to exert checks on judicial power – to investigate or even impeach judges who abuse their office or interpret the law in ways that violate its spirit, and to affirm that the elected branches will hold more sway over policy than the appointed one. But the chief justice’s show of indifference to congressional oversight authority reflects a new reality: that there are now effectively no checks on the power of the court – at least none that Democrats have the political will to use – and that the justices can be assured that they will face no repercussions even if they act in flagrant violation of ethical standards. It seems that they intend to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race. Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation. , Tyler Dupree, James Harrison and Matty Ashton have left part-time rugby league behind and are now in line to face France  Ever heard the one about the electrician, the lifeguard and the builder who went on to represent their country? There could be as many as 15 debutants when a new-look England side takes to the field against France in Warrington on Saturday afternoon, with Shaun Wane sticking to his promise of ripping up the squad that fell short in last year’s Rugby League World Cup and integrating a younger group of players in anticipation for the next tournament in France in 2025. All of those players have their own unique stories to tell, but three in particular can scarcely believe they have reached this point. As recently as 18 months ago, Tyler Dupree and James Harrison were not even full-time Super League players, with Dupree involved in the Oldham side relegated to League 1, the sport’s lowest professional tier, and Harrison playing for Featherstone Rovers. They were released by Leeds and Bradford respectively as teenagers, told they were not good enough and, cast aside from the professional ranks, forced to go part-time. , Suella Braverman flags statutory instrument to public order bill as climate protesters renew campaign Suella Braverman is to give police the power to ban slow walking in traffic by protesters, as Just Stop Oil enters the fifth consecutive day of using the tactic in the latest phase of its climate protest campaign.

National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the figure, based on US intelligence estimates, included more than 20,000 dead, half of them from the Wagner group. Russia unleashed a fresh missile attack on Ukraine in the east, killing two people, setting off huge blazes and damaging dozens of homes and other buildings in the city of Pavlohrad. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the two deaths in his video address on Monday night. “Forty other people - women, children, men – were treated for wounds and injuries,” he said. Zelenskiy also said a 14-year-boy was killed near his school when it was hit by a bomb in the Chernihiv region, close to the Russian border. An explosion in the western region of Bryansk bordering Ukraine derailed a Russian freight train on Monday, the local governor said in a social media post. “An unidentified explosive device went off, as a result of which a locomotive of a freight train derailed,” Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram, adding that there were no casualties reported. Russian authorities say the region, which borders Ukraine and Belarus, has seen multiple attacks by pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups in the 14 months since Russia invaded. Ukrainian counterattacks have ousted Russian forces from some positions in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, but the situation remains “quite difficult”, a top Ukrainian general has said. However, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, added: “At the same time, in certain parts of the city, the enemy was counterattacked by our units and left some positions.” Syrskyi made the remarks while visiting frontline troops on Sunday, the military said. The head of the Wagner private militia renewed his appeal to Russia’s defence ministry to increase ammunition shipments to his fighters trying to seize Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin has frequently clashed with Moscow’s defence establishment over the conduct of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine and what he says is insufficient support being provided to his Wagner soldiers. In a video posted on his Telegram channel, Prigozhin said he needs at least 300 tonnes of artillery shells a day for the assault, Reuters reported. Since last summer Russia has built “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades” in the areas it controls in Ukraine as well as in its own border regions, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a statement condemning the former children’s ombudsman of Russia, Pavel Astakhov, for comments he made on Russian state TV that murdering ambassadors is “within the framework of international law”, with specific reference to Poland’s ambassador. Poland called on Russia “to ensure the safety of all diplomats in accordance with the Vienna Convention”. In Washington, House speaker Kevin McCarthy emphatically stressed his support for military aid to Ukraine on Monday, criticising Russia’s “killing of the children” and distancing himself from some in his party who oppose additional major US aid to repel the Russian invasion. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken to New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins. Ukraine’s president said the pair discussed “further cooperation on defence and humanitarian issues” and “the need for further consolidation of the countries of the Pacific region in supporting Ukraine.” , Watching sea snakes swim through water is soothing – until you remember they are real Sea snakes are, in animal form, the feeling the deep end of the pool gives you when you are a child, when suddenly you feel you are swimming at night, or when you are in bed but not totally sure the floor beneath hasn’t turned into water and sharks. And because sea snakes aren’t where they’re meant to be – everything you know tells you snakes don’t belong in the sea – the more you learn about them, the more you encounter all that you don’t know: the words are weird, you understand their meaning but can’t read their letters, they are words in a dream – or was it a nightmare? Black-banded sea kraits, a type of sea snake, hunt with yellow goatfish; in New Caledonia, they are called “stripy sweaters”. Kraits are “elapid”, which means their fangs are always erect. Sea snake lungs are almost as long as their bodies; they can breathe through their skin. Their tongues are shorter than those of land snakes: only the forked part pokes out.

Many did so in the conviction that leaving the European Union would turn Britain into a smaller, more insular place, closing off possibilities and prospects in their own lives. They feared a birthright was being lost; one which allowed them a bigger, wider sense of belonging. Seven years on, that judgment is vindicated in a report by a cross-party committee of the House of Lords. Entitled The Future UK-EU Relationship, the peers’ analysis finds that, since the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with Brussels in 2021, “post-Brexit barriers to mobility between the UK and the EU, in both directions, have had an especially significant impact on young people”. , Building a healthier, more prosperous country will mean addressing the problem of low-paid, precarious employment  What’s the best way to fix Britain’s economy? According to Labour and the Conservatives, the answer is growth. Yet this focus overlooks another fundamental reason for Britain’s sluggish productivity. The UK is unwell. Every year, 2% of its GDP – or £43bn – is lost due to poor health, according to new findings from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). More people are leaving work due to long-term health conditions and more are claiming disability benefits. So long as this persists, calling for growth will be like attempting to compete in a race while being too sick and exhausted to run. The reasons for Britain’s ill health have been widely discussed. Poverty is a major cause. Those on low incomes are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and struggle to afford life’s essentials. If social housing was plentiful, nutritious food subsidised and heating permanently affordable, poverty would not be as harmful to health. But a decade of cuts to public services has left those on low incomes even more exposed. Meanwhile, Whitehall has focused its energies on the NHS, viewing medical treatment as the job of the state and prevention as the responsibility of individuals. Broader health has not been a government priority – a fact signalled by the cynical decision to scrap Public Health England in 2020. , Readers take issue with Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman’s  rhetoric on asylum seekers’ ‘values’ As a volunteer with an organisation helping to support refugees and asylum seekers in Hertfordshire, I have to take issue with Robert Jenrick when he says that their “values and lifestyles” threaten the UK’s social cohesion (‘Values and lifestyles’ of small boat refugees threaten social cohesion, says Jenrick, 25 April). The asylum seekers I have met have been polite, charmingly grateful for our help and eager to get on with their lives. This means working to improve their English – at college, as soon as they are eligible – and, since asylum seekers are not allowed to earn money, keen to volunteer their services to charities and other organisations. The parents are as concerned for their children’s wellbeing as any UK parents, care for them lovingly and encourage them to work hard at school. Meanwhile, they are coping with the trauma of lives disrupted by violence, the turmoil of their journeys to get here and the stresses of living, usually in one room, in a strange country where they are dependent on the kindness of strangers for clothing, shoes and all the necessities of life. In my view, the UK will benefit immeasurably from their presence and the skills and values they bring. Vicky WoodcraftTrustee, Herts Welcomes Refugees , Sudanese crisis | Food prices | Tory foot soldiers | Value of the monarchy | Swearing allegiance I await with interest the UK government’s response to the Sudanese refugee crisis. Given the precedent of providing refuge for those escaping the war in Ukraine, we could reasonably expect that the same would apply to those fleeing violence in Sudan, and that British families would open their doors to them. After all, Britain has been far more closely associated with Sudan than with Ukraine, having had a history of occupation stretching back 150 years.Douglas CurrieEdinburgh • After reading Andy Beckett’s piece on profiteering (Britain once rioted over the price of bread. What would it take for us to confront greedflation today?, 28 April), I went for my weekly shop to a major supermarket (bill double what it used to be). I wanted a small tub of mustard and cress, but it was 60p. I went to my local farm shop, where the same thing cost me 30p.Helen PeirceTeignmouth, Devon ,  Belgian defeats four-time world champion 18-15 in final ‘This has been a crazy week, no practice, just partying’ It may have taken him nine years more than he originally planned, but Luca Brecel’s childhood prophecy has finally been fulfilled. Before he had even stepped through the doors of a Crucible Theatre as a highly-rated 17-year-old, becoming the youngest player in the tournament’s history, the Belgian had already predicted he would become world champion by the age of 19. That, clearly, did not materialise as planned. Brecel hadn’t even won a match here as recently as three weeks ago, going out in the first round on all five of his previous appearances at the Crucible. But now, snooker has its first world champion from mainland Europe and the boy who first picked up a cue as a precocious nine-year-old has delivered on his promise. ,  Wolfsburg win in extra time in WCL semi-final Eidevall says his side is ‘allowed to hurt tonight’ Jonas Eidevall said his Arsenal side is “allowed to hurt tonight and feel empty, but we are also allowed to feel proud of the performance and the occasion”, following a 3-2 semi-final defeat against Wolfsburg deep into extra time to end dreams of a place in the Champions League final. “We made it to the Champions League semi-final and lost by the tiniest of margins,” the Arsenal manager said. “With all the injuries we have, with all the challenges we have, I am incredibly proud.” , An interrogative exhibition at the New-York Historical Society examines the social, cultural and civil rights impact of development and devastation “I want people to understand that the environmental crisis is bound up inextricably in our cultural world and how we relate to each other,” Dr Wendy Nālani E Ikemoto is discussing Nature, Crisis, Consequence, which she curated for the New-York Historical Society. The show juxtaposes classics of 19th-century American naturalism with works by artists from communities largely left out of the historical narratives that these works have been central in enshrining. “It’s not just a problem of science and numbers, it is indivisible from the way we treat each other. How is the environmental crisis also a civil rights crisis?” Running through 16 July, Nature, Crisis, Consequence emerged from a request made of Ikemoto to create a show to feature the NYHS’s 19th-century Hudson River school paintings. Among the Society’s most popular holdings, the Hudson River school works show a romanticized, pastoral version of well-known landscapes upstate from New York City, now thoroughly marked by human development and activity. “They wanted them back on view because they’re so popular,” said Ikemoto, “but I didn’t want to just put these paintings back on the wall.” , Greenpeace Belgium working to release 14 protesters who sailed inflatables into the Fluxys LGN terminal in Zeebrugge Fourteen Greenpeace activists have been held for more than 48 hours after trespassing into and occupying a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal in Zeebrugge, Belgium Greenpeace Belgium said it was working for their release. Valerie Del Re, director of Greenpeace Belgium, said: “It’s not our activists, but gas companies like Fluxys who are the criminals in this story. , Exclusive: up to 10 disused cruise liners, ferries and barges sought to help tackle processing delays The Home Office is planning to use 10 redundant cruise ships, ferries and barges to house asylum seekers in ports around the country, with Liverpool expected to be next in line as ministers struggle to get to grips with the asylum backlog. Officials have been told to look at “all options” to find housing for people caught up in processing delays, including former military camps and prisons, with the total backlog more than 1,500 higher than in December when Rishi Sunak pledged to clear it within a year. , Carl O’Keeffe was taken to hospital after incident at Kong Adventure Centre but died from his injuries The family of a man who died after getting stuck in a cave at an indoor climbing centre in the Lake District say they have been left “broken-hearted”. Carl O’Keeffe, a 49-year-old man from Lancaster, was attending a birthday party with his niece in the Kong Adventure Centre in Keswick, Cumbria on 22 April, Sky News reported. , Move by senior party figures comes after fellow MP said she was worried about how force was handling crimes against woman Labour MPs have spoken to Leicestershire police after Stella Creasy expressed concern about how the force was “dealing with crimes against women” in response to their handling of her harassment case. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, and Liz Kendall, the shadow health secretary, spoke to police after Creasy criticised their handling of a harassment case against a troll who made a baseless complaint about her to social services. , Supporters claim government to rule she broke civil service code in bid to delay role as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Former senior official Sue Gray is facing a “political witch-hunt”, allies believe, with the government set to conclude that she broke the civil service code, in an alleged bid to delay her appointment as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff until after the next general election. Ministers are expected to announce on Tuesday that an internal inquiry into Gray’s departure from Whitehall has concluded that she breached the code by holding talks with Labour about the new role without informing civil service officials. , FSB says business confidence is rising but soaring costs and weakening demand is still slowing growth Small businesses across Britain are warning that the cost of living squeeze is holding back economic growth, after two in five company bosses reported a drop in sales at the start of the year. The Federation of Small Businesses said that although business confidence was rising among bosses before the summer, soaring costs and weakness in consumer demand were still weighing on activity. , Prof Marian Knight says action needed to improve diagnosis of condition in which fertilised egg implants itself outside womb  ‘Worst thing that’s ever happened to me’: the trauma of ectopic pregnancy Women are dying or suffering avoidable harm because of a failure to recognise ectopic pregnancy, one of the country’s leading experts on maternal health has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Prof Marian Knight of the University of Oxford, who leads a national research programme on maternal deaths, called for action to improve diagnosis of the acute, life-threatening condition, in which a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb, normally in the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are never viable and if left untreated can result in the tube rupturing, causing potentially fatal internal bleeding. , Critical shortages of basic goods including water, and bodies piling in streets creating ‘environmental catastrophe’ Sudanese medics have described seeing piles of bodies in the streets of the capital, Khartoum, people drinking polluted water, and doctors working under bombardments as the battle between the country’s two warring generals continues despite a threadbare ceasefire. Intense explosions and shelling were audible in Omdurman, Khartoum’s twin city across the Nile, on Monday and there were reports of further explosions and clashes in the Bahri and Kafouri districts of Khartoum North. In the south of Khartoum, residents reported that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fired anti-aircraft missiles in response to bombardments by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). , The network and Trump had a difficult relationship when he was in office, but the event could goose both of their ratings The announcement that CNN will host a New Hampshire town hall event for Donald Trump was met with widespread criticism on Monday. Angelo Carusone, chief executive of Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog, said: “The transparent attempt to goose their ratings does feel at least a little odious. But all the more reason that they need to get this right.” , Writer tells New York jury George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, encouraged her to take legal action The advice columnist E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump for rape after she was encouraged to take legal action by George Conway, the husband of a top aide to the then president. On her third day on the witness stand, Carroll told the jury hearing her lawsuit for battery and defamation over the alleged sexual assault in a New York department store changing room in 1996 that she did not intend to sue Trump until he called her a liar when she went public with her accusations more than two decades later. , Have you cringed so hard you turned into a fossil?

Today’s dishes are great for impressing vegetarian friends or family, or if you simply want a meat-free dish without feeling as if you’re missing out. If you don’t want to use tofu, swap it for crunchy veg, such as carrot, asparagus or spring cabbage, to create a contrasting texture for the noodles. , Advance raises prospect of new ways to restore speech in those struggling to communicate due to stroke or motor neurone disease An AI-based decoder that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text has been developed, in a breakthrough that allows a person’s thoughts to be read non-invasively for the first time. The decoder could reconstruct speech with uncanny accuracy while people listened to a story – or even silently imagined one – using only fMRI scan data. Previous language decoding systems have required surgical implants, and the latest advance raises the prospect of new ways to restore speech in patients struggling to communicate due to a stroke or motor neurone disease. , Discovery could help plug gaps in understanding of evolution after Cambrian explosion more than 500m years ago Many people discovered new interests closer to home as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. For Dr Joseph Botting and Dr Lucy Muir, it was a 10-metre-wide quarry in a sheep field near to their home in Llandrindod, central Wales, which appeared to be teeming with tiny fossils. Now researchers believe the site could help plug gaps in scientific understanding of how evolution proceeded after the Cambrian explosion – the period when the ancestors of most modern animals are believed to have evolved. It could even prove to be as important as the Burgess Shale in Canada that preserves one of the world’s first complex marine ecosystems, experts say. , Global fleet has more than doubled in two decades, with more private flights made last year than ever before Sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year, placing an increasing burden on the planet, while many of the owners escape aviation taxes, and there are few curbs on the greenhouse gases emitted, according to a report. The global fleet of private jets has more than doubled in the last two decades, and more private flights were made last year than ever before, according to a thinktank report published on Monday. Greenhouse gas emissions from private aviation have increased by nearly a quarter since the pandemic, when flying of all types nearly ceased in many countries for an extended period. , The Guardian’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world , Freight train derailed in border region of Bryansk; children among those injured in attack that appeared to target ammunition depot  At a glance: what we know on day 432 of the invasion Hello, and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Ukraine’s armed forces say they shot down 15 out of 18 missiles launched by Russia in the early hours of Monday morning. , US banking titan to buy ‘all deposits and substantially all assets’ in deal brokered by regulators to contain banking failures JP Morgan is to acquire most of the failed California bank First Republic, in a takeover brokered by regulators as the US races to contain a series of banking failures that has echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis. After weekend talks to prevent a further escalation of the US banking crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. The regulator is providing $50bn (£39.9bn) of financing as part of the deal. , From Lady Chatterley’s Lover to novels about trans children, attempts to suppress works of literature tend to have the opposite effect The 17th century rector of St Alban’s College in Valladolid, Spain, must have rolled his eyes at the size of the book he had to review for the library. The Jesuit seminary, known as the English College because it produced missionaries committed to the reconversion of England to Catholicism, had received a 900-page volume of Shakespeare’s plays. William Sankey prepared his quill and began the long work of censoring ungodly, anti-Catholic and otherwise unsuitable material. “Holy-day fools” – a jibe in the Tempest that seemed to impugn the Christian calendar – struck out. “Heavier soon by the weight of a man”, as Margaret tells Hero on the eve of her wedding in Much Ado About Nothing – filth – blotted into unreadability with heavy ink. A play about a pretend friar and a novice nun: actually, at Measure for Measure Sankey admitted defeat, put down his pen and took a sharp blade to cut out the pages of the entire play. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Dozens of nurses have gathered outside London’s University College Hospital, chanting and singing. Waving placards that demand fair pay and state “enough is enough”, the nurses asked how they could be expected to get by on their current pay, and said they are unable to provide acceptable care to patients due to staffing issues. As staff lined the steps of the hospital, cancer care staff nurse Preya Assi, from Hackney in east London, said: This is a culmination of our pay not reflecting the hours we are working. The last decade has made things considerably worse. Our colleagues are out in force because things have got so bad that we cannot pay our rent or our bills, we are relying on food banks. We have spent the last few years fighting the pandemic. It matters to us and the care we provide matters to us. The fact the government are not looking at our pay has caused us to do this. It’s a profession that I love, I love caring for people, and when I started the job it was not like this. The money was small, but it was sufficient, and we were proud of being a nurse. The definition of nursing is about caring for people and making them comfortable if they are at the end of their lives, but how is that possible when there is one nurse having to look after 10 patients at a time because we’re short-staffed? How am I supposed to live? If I don’t pay my council tax, they take me to court, or if I don’t pay my rent, I lose my home. At 70, I’m still working; what life is that? They are clapping for us but refuse to pay us properly. If they (politicians) were here, I would tell them to their faces. , Officials claim material on Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”.

Based in Shropshire and operating from six vast sheds that churn out 1.3m chickens a year, the business has been hit by a cocktail of pressures. , Unlike the coronation quiche, there wasn’t a broad bean in sight when we asked readers to name their most-loved combinations. From chorizo to asparagus to king trumpet mushrooms, which should you try? Compared to the super-elaborate swiss-roll-and-amaretti trifle introduced to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee last year, King Charles’s coronation quiche seems an underwhelming choice. Its chief innovation – the addition of broad beans – is seasonal but unexciting. And at the end of the day, it’s still just a quiche. Surely, we thought, Guardian readers could do better. An appeal for your own favourite quiche variations was launched. Submissions flooded in. Many refused to enter into the spirit of the exercise – “I hate quiche!” was one, not atypical response. But plenty of variations – from the humble to the exotic to the, frankly, quixotic – were offered up. I was determined to replicate three of them. , A pioneering singing programme from opera houses across Britain is bringing joy to those still struggling with little support I can’t say there’s been a lot of joy having long Covid, but something rather wonderful is happening at the London Coliseum. As part of the English National Opera (ENO) Breathe programme, more than 2,500 of us across England have been meeting in groups on Zoom to do various breathing and vocal exercises, and sing lullabies. This is not a choir, but a social prescribing intervention that uses singing techniques for breathing retraining to aid recovery from Covid-19. Many patients with long Covid have reported that they permanently feel in “flight or fight” mode and struggle to “rest and digest” as the body should. Research shows that this is because of an imbalance in our autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for subconscious processes such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and temperature regulation. Using breathing and other techniques has been shown to help engage a key nerve, the vagus, which can calm an overstimulated system to address this imbalance and put on the brakes. Joanna Herman is a consultant in infectious diseases in London, and teaches at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , With households feeling the squeeze, more retailers are offering dual-use furnishings and gadgets From colourful cushions that look as good in the living room as on the lawn to portable lamps and speakers fit for home working and garden parties, a new breed of versatile household products allows you to economise by furnishing your home and garden in one go. Traditionally, Britons have bought dedicated garden kit but with household finances under pressure and a growing desire to shop more sustainably, retailers have turned to selling “indoor-outdoor” furnishings and gadgets. “We’re seeing customers buying products that have a dual use and look just as good inside the home as they do out,” says the John Lewis head of home accessories, Camilla Rowe. , Many states have restricted how schools can teach race and gender, but only Texas has banned student interaction with elected officials The defining experience of Jordan Zamora-Garcia’s high school career – a hands-on group project in civics class that spurred a new city ordinance in his Austin suburb – would now violate Texas law. Since Texas lawmakers in 2021 passed a ban on lessons teaching that any one group is “inherently racist, sexist or oppressive”, a little-noticed provision of that legislation has triggered a massive fallout for civics education across the state. , RCN leader urges health secretary to resolve ongoing pay dispute as one-day strike affects cancer and emergency care for first time  Nine out of 10 teachers in England have a negative view of Ofsted, according to a new poll that comes amid calls to overhaul the schools inspectorate following the death of headteacher Ruth Perry. The survey of 1,000 teachers carried out by YouGov last week found that just 7% had a favourable view of Ofsted while 90% said they had an unfavourable view; including 67% who had a “very unfavourable” view of the organisation headed by chief inspector Amanda Spielman. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election? And not least of the reasons for making that the benchmark is that, if you look at what happened before the 1997 general election when Tony Blair won a landslide for Labour, Labour in the local elections leading up to 1997 were regularly recording double-digit leads in what we call the projected national share. , Officials claim material about Jimmy Lai constituted political slogans but David Davis calls heavy-handed approach ‘completely daft’  UK politics live – latest updates Parliamentary security guards confiscated reports and leaflets about Hong Kong from attenders of an event in Westminster in case they caused political upset, the Guardian has learned, in a move condemned by a senior Conservative MP as “completely daft”.

Prof Sir John Curtice said those wanting a clue as to who could win the next general election should be focused on the projected national vote share as the results of Thursday’s poll roll in, rather than on the number of council seats gained. Undoubtedly, the question above all that we’re asking ourselves about what we’ll see on Thursday is does the Labour party put in the kind of performance, if we compare it with previous local elections, that might lead us to believe – which the polls have been telling us for the last six months or so – that they have a chance of winning the next general election?

Once in the brain, “Plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s,” Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes.

Arteta added that his side clearly need to improve if they hope to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, starting with a win over Chelsea on Tuesday. Arsenal have been overtaken by City at the top of the table following a winless run of four games, including draws with Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton. , Newspapers’ power is being eroded and disinformation is rife – but there is a way forward Our understanding of the world is driven by information. It feeds our ability to make informed decisions about our lives, our communities, the way we’re governed. This fundamental freedom, the power to be able to access reliable information, sits at the heart of a thriving democratic society. But increasingly that power is being eroded. Indeed, some never had it to begin with. Press freedom is being threatened, compromised and denied in an increasing number of countries around the world.

Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: “Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe, and those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition.” , Russian missiles have struck warehouses reportedly storing ammunition at a railway depot in the Ukrainian city of Pavlohrad injuring at least 34 people; Ukraine claims to have shot down 15 of 18 missiles fired overnight , A sharp and lucid case for gaining wisdom through adversity rather than books If aught can teach us aught, Affliction’s looks,\n",

Both sides said a formal ceasefire agreement that was due to expire at midnight would be extended for a further 72 hours. The army said it hoped what it called the “rebels” would abide by the deal but it believed they had intended to keep up attacks. The parties have kept fighting through a series of ceasefires over the past week. , Turkish president says Abu Hussein al-Qurashi was killed after long pursuit while northern Syria residents report clashes and large explosion Turkish intelligence forces have killed Islamic State’s leader, Abu Hussein al-Qurashi, in Syria, Turkey’s president has said. “This individual was neutralised as part of an operation by the Turkish national intelligence organisation in Syria yesterday,” Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in an interview with the broadcaster TRT Türk on Sunday. , Paetongtarn, 36, is leading polls to become Thailand’s next prime minister, boosted by the popularity of the Shinawatra name Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the frontrunner in the upcoming Thai election, has given birth to a baby boy two weeks before voters go to the polls. Paetongtarn, the youngest daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, posted a picture of her baby, named Prutthasin Sooksawas, nickname Thasin, on social media on Monday. , Strike affecting half of NHS England trusts as pay dispute continues  Cullen has defended her union’s support for the ongoing strikes, despite previously recommending nurses accept an offer from the government. Speaking about the offer and the decision by RCN members to reject it, Cullen told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: What our nursing staff said was it was neither fair nor reasonable – it puts money in their pockets now but in the long term it doesn’t address recruitment and retention issues. There were some elements of the pay offer that were attractive to our ruling council; for example around safe nurse staffing policy work that’s required in order for us to be able to move to a place where we have safe nurse staffing legislation in place. Patients will still be seen if they unfortunately need to use an emergency department, of course that will always happen. But the delivery of care may be delayed if it is not a life-threatening emergency. If it is an emergency, you will be treated as normal. That’s why we are really emphasising the importance of people not delaying seeking medical help and calling 999 as normal or using 111. But it is inevitable that there will be disruption to normal care even in those services where we have agreed mitigations with the Royal College of Nursing. Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe. And those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition. They don’t turn their back on patients, they will continue to do what they need to do. , Fair Judgement raises funds for case in response to death of Berkshire primary headteacher Ruth Perry A group of senior school leaders is calling on teachers to donate £1 each to launch a legal challenge against Ofsted, pledging to hold the inspectorate to account for “ending careers” and causing a mental health crisis. The vice-president of the Conservative education society, John Bald, a former Ofsted inspector, is fronting a crowdfunding page for the group, which is called Fair Judgement. The leaders fear the inspectorate may seek to punish their schools if they go public.

Prigozhin, whose group is spearheading Russia’s attack on the embattled city of Bakhmut, predicted a Ukrainian counterattack in mid-May and said Wagner had “only 10-15% of the shells that we need.” Pope Francis has said that the Vatican is involved in a peace mission to try to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I am willing to do everything that has to be done. There is a mission in course now but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it,” Pope Francis told reporters during a flight home after a three-day visit to Hungary. The Russian army replaced its highest ranking general in charge of logistics, after days of rumours about the sacking of Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said Alexei Kuzmenkov – a former official from the National Guard – had replaced Mizintsev as “deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation, responsible for the logistical support of the Armed Forces.” The statement did not say why Mizintsev was replaced after just seven months in the job. Ukraine said its troops were holding on to parts of the eastern city of Bakhmut. “The enemy is unable to take control over the city, despite throwing all its forces into the battle and having some success,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said its forces had taken four blocks in western Bakhmut on Sunday, according to Reuters, which could not independently confirm the claim. Four people have been killed from an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka, the governor of Russia’s western Bryansk region said on Sunday. “Two more civilians have been found and removed from the rubble. Unfortunately, both of them died,” local governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Russian commanders have likely started “punishing breaches in discipline by detaining the offending troops in ‘Zindans’ which are improvised cells consisting of holes in the ground covered with a metal grille,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. The army is thought to have been using “increasingly draconian” measures to enforce discipline since autumn 2022, the MoD said, and “especially since Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov assumed command of the operation in January 2023.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a “long and meaningful” telephone conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The French presidency said Macron had reaffirmed France’s support for Ukraine to Zelenskiy, and that Macron had given an update on European coordination to give Ukraine military help. Funerals were held for some of the 23 people who were killed on Friday when two Russian missiles hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city Uman. Six children were among the dead. With Reuters and AFP , Thirty years after the racist murder of his friend, Brooks wants to run the city whose police failed him and so many others – as a Conservative. What makes him think he can do better than Sadiq Khan? Saturday 22 April was the 30th anniversary of the day Stephen Lawrence was murdered by racist youths while waiting for a bus in south-east London. Lawrence’s family along with public figures including Keir Starmer and Sadiq Khan attended a memorial service in central London, but not his friend Duwayne Brooks, who was with him when he was attacked. “I was refereeing,” he says matter-of-factly. Like he does every weekend, for his south London football league. Not that Brooks believes the occasion shouldn’t be remembered. “In my opinion it’s got to be marked every year,” he says. “It’s not just the Lawrence family that suffered because of what happened to their son – there are families across Britain who have suffered similar in terms of their children being taken so young.” , Diane and David Rowsell were looking forward to spending more time with the grandchildren. Then they discovered how many of their neighbours in York were going hungry “We fell into it,” says Diane Rowsell, 63, of the community food support project that she and husband David, 64, started in 2020. “It wasn’t like we sat at home thinking: ‘What can we do with our lives now?’” Pre-retirement they were busy: David’s job as a headteacher allowed them to live in the Czech Republic and the US, where Diane, a physiotherapist by training, also worked teaching music; they travelled extensively and adventurously in their free time. Back home in York, they were looking forward to more travel, plus time on their allotment and with their grandchildren. “Just that era of life – busy doing not much!” says Diane. But it doesn’t sound that quiet when she explains that the couple bought a camper van, David was working as a leadership coach, she was taking art classes, and both were volunteering – Diane gardening and David chairing the local school board of governors.

But alongside what you might expect (a commemorative plate or King Charles mug) are some rather unusual offerings, as some businesses and their PR teams seem to be doing anything possible to mark the day. We’ve done a roundup of the most unexpected coronation merchandise out there, as well as the simply awkward and bizarre. , He was a trail-blazing genius who electrified US ballet. But he was also a dictatorial grudge-bearer who married four of his dancers. How should we remember the Russian-American choreographer? ‘I don’t have a past. I have a continuous present,” said the great Russian-American choreographer George Balanchine, a great believer in forward motion. When Balanchine’s health began to fail, in his mid-70s, he resisted making a will, not thinking that the hundreds of ballets he had created would live on without him. When the IRS posthumously valued his repertory, it decided that the maximum shelf life of even his greatest ballets was just 15 years. Yet today, almost exactly 40 years after Balanchine’s death, his works are as popular as ever. New York City Ballet (NYCB), the company he founded, has just announced its 75th anniversary season, with dozens of performances of his works. Masterful ballets such as Serenade, Symphony in C and Agon are still regularly danced around the world. This summer, the Australian Ballet comes to the UK to perform his Jewels. When Carlos Acosta marks his 50th birthday on stage in July, it is Balanchine’s Apollo that he will dance. , Air pollution and the climate crisis are making pollen even more of a menace. Here’s how to stop your eyes itching and nose streaming If you’ve found yourself reaching for the tissues more than usual recently, you’re not alone. The sun has shown its face a bit, and thanks to the arrival of a tree pollen bomb, which occurs when groups of trees release millions of grains of pollen at the same time, many of us are trading the joys of spring for itchy eyes and streaming noses. According to Margaret Kelman, acting head of clinical services at Allergy UK, the number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years, with the condition now affecting one in four adults in the UK. “Climate change, including increased air pollution, has contributed to more intense pollen seasons,” she says. “Warmer weather speeds up the growing process, causing pollen seasons to start earlier and last longer.” , It’s gripping, nuanced, almost unbearably tense – and it’s about to come to an end. The BBC show’s take on policing post-Troubles Belfast is one of the finest watches of the year When Blue Lights first appeared, it was hard to get too excited about yet another cop show. We are only at the end of April and already the year has been stuffed with them, from the great (Happy Valley) to the functionally decent (Unforgotten) to the fine (Better), you can’t move for a moody detective or a seemingly uncrackable case. One theory about their enduring appeal is that police procedurals are the most psychologically satisfying form of storytelling, because they fulfil what the human brain finds pleasurable about drama – a puzzle to solve, red herrings and false starts, and the idea that somebody knows what’s going on, even if we don’t yet. Written and co-created by Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson (who wrote The Salisbury Poisonings), Blue Lights sets itself apart from the pack. The series – whose final episode airs on BBC One tonight – has a journalistic eye for detail and nuance. It sidesteps the case-of-the-week template, preferring to take an overview of the incredibly complex world of policing in Belfast. This is rich material. First broadcast just before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it paints a detailed picture of the city as it is today, with the Troubles never far from that picture, whether in the highly sensitive issue of policing by consent (and consent is not a given), or in the histories of the men (and women) involved in organised crime. , Scottish-born chef started career in kitchens at the age of 12 before moving to Australia and opening prize-winning restaurants that faltered as mainstream success grew  • Jock Zonfrillo, MasterChef Australia judge and chef, dies aged 46 As a culinary figure, Jock Zonfrillo reached the highest peaks in Australia, his adopted homeland. He won national and international awards, and went on to become a television star with a coveted judging spot on MasterChef. However the life of the chef and television personality, who died on 30 April at age 46, had great lows, both private and public. Zonfrillo, whose legal name is Barry, was raised in Ayr, Scotland. His father, Ivan, was a barber, and his paternal grandparents had migrated to Scotland from Italy, while his mother Sarah’s family were farmers in Scotland. , The site’s success has led to it being accused of swamping tourist hotspots with short-term lets and forcing out locals With its burgeoning, vibrant arts scene, Margate was the perfect base for Dan Thompson, a writer and social activist. But when his landlord came to sell his flat, he was left with nowhere to move to, due to a shortage of properties in the area. One reason, he believes, is that many of the homes are let as short-term rentals on Airbnb. Almost 640 entire homes are let out in the coastal town, according to rental analytics company AirDNA. , We tried and tried, but failed and failed. Yet the fertility industry kept offering us hope, so long as we offered them money Is it possible to become addicted to fertility treatment? When does spending tens of thousands of pounds on IVF with no guarantee that it will actually work become a gambling problem? These are the questions I am searching for answers to as I meet virtually with a doctor from a top London fertility clinic. “Women are a mystery,” he jokes. I smile politely into the tiny camera on my laptop. I had been considering treatment with his clinic and we have spent the last hour running through my history of infertility, or rather, in my case, incomplete fertility. My husband and I have been trying for nine years to have a baby. I’m quite good at getting pregnant, especially when we first started trying, but I can’t seem to stay pregnant. I don’t know why. And as it turns out, neither do the experts. I have spent years seeking their help, and because IVF wasn’t available on the NHS in my area, I have paid thousands of pounds along the way in my relentless pursuit of pregnancy. , The Guardian was right to remove and delete the cartoon published on Saturday, but with all that is known about anti-Jewish symbols and images, this should not be happening Other than his closest friends, it is unlikely that anybody would complain if a Guardian cartoonist drew Boris Johnson as a gorilla. All’s fair in political satire, cartoonists are expected to be scurrilous, and the former prime minister is fair game. But if that same cartoonist drew a black politician in simian form, it would be obviously racist. This is the principle to hold in mind when decoding Martin Rowson’s cartoon of outgoing BBC chair Richard Sharp, who is Jewish, in Saturday’s Guardian. Centuries of anti-Jewish caricaturists (and to be clear, I do not accuse Rowson or the Guardian of falling into this category) have generated an extensive library of visual tropes to convey their hatred of, and disgust for, Jews. This is partly because antisemites face a challenge: how do you incite hatred against a group of people who are not always readily identifiable? Not every Jew wears religious clothing or “looks Jewish” to every beholder. Dr Dave Rich is author of Everyday Hate: How antisemitism is built into our world and how you can change it , There is unease about what happens next. We’re not perfect, but politicians will do anything but address their own shortcomings So, exactly who is making the UK apparently ungovernable? Is it bullying, psychotic ministers intent on stoking the culture wars until Gary Lineker, the BBC, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and every other woke-sucking, electorate-hating public institution is consumed by its righteous flames? Or is it, more specifically, us “over-unionised”, “activist” civil servants – who, despite being a “very small minority” of milquetoast snowflakes, are still somehow capable of orchestrating the ruthless defenestration of Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay and any other poor minister who dares to actually get something – anything – done? , The Harold and Maude actor shows us that spur of the moment acts of generosity can be truly life affirming On the first day directing my first film came my first communication error. I’d asked the costume department to take a man’s shirt (which the lead character had stolen after a one night stand), and fashion it into something she fixes around her cat to stop it picking at its surgical stitches. Expecting it to look like a striped cotton bandage, I was presented with a cat wearing an immaculately tailored miniature button-down. In the end I took it off the cat, but I wish I’d made that work because, when I’ve occasionally daydreamed about the etymology of phrases, I’ve always felt drawn to “the shirt off my back”. At the end of the shoot, my lead, Jemima Kirke, slipped off a diamond and ruby fox ring and handed it to me – the ring off her own finger! I was touched by the gesture and by the echo from a woman I’d cast as “me”: I’d done this same thing myself to friends when I felt they needed moral support, unhooking a bracelet or brooch and pressing it into their palm. It’s never the value of the jewellery that matters as much as the instant decision. Maybe it’s a sense of memory conversation with the ancestors who sewed valuables into their clothes as they fled expulsions, pogroms and ghettoes; letting the past know I feel safe enough in my own life to give my precious things away. I’d say I’ve lost three pieces of jewellery this way, but they’re the opposite of lost. , I have explained what has happened to me, on my own terms, and people have responded in kind I’ve had a double mastectomy. I don’t find it straightforward to spell or to pronounce, but it’s the term I find easiest to use when I tell people what has happened to me. I just can’t put it in plain English, and say exactly what the surgeons did. This may change, but it seems too painful to me, and I worry about the people listening. Generally, since I was diagnosed with breast cancer last summer I have tried to avoid couching things in terms that may be unclear. Years of writing articles on complicated financial products and schemes in my roles on the Guardian’s Money and Investigations desks have conditioned me to avoid jargon. I like to get to the point and use language that is accessible, rather than words that exclude people, and in the main I have taken this approach to my illness. Hilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editor , The president is trying to appeal to climate-conscious young voters and appease the fossil fuel industry. It won’t work Just before announcing that he would again run for president, Joe Biden signed off on what on the surface looks like a great move to help address the climate crisis: an executive order that creates an office of environmental justice in the White House. “Environmental justice,” the president said from the Rose Garden, “will be the mission of the entire government, woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments.” That is a beautiful sentiment. And sentiment, when coupled with substantive policy positions, can lead the country forward. The idea of a White House office that can help mobilize an all-of-government response to the climate crisis could be a force multiplier in the fight to save the planet. But to be effective it needs real presidential leadership that involves the creation of a bold and realistic plan to phase out fossil fuels along a strict timeline. Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer, a Guardian US columnist, and the creator of the Substack newsletter Donziger on Justice , Unsuccessful US college applicants have started having cathartic parties to ‘celebrate’. I think they might be on to something High school students in the US are tackling the brutal process of college applications with rejection parties, the New York Times reported last week. At one school, students bring along a printout of their college rejections, ceremonially feed them into a shredder, then get an ice-cream; there is a prize for the most rejected. It sounds wonderful: a cathartic, collective “screw you” to a broken system, using fun to salve the pain. I wonder if owning rejection is easier in the US, where there is at least a partial sense that failure is OK; it’s considered a learning opportunity and a key part of the origin story. The Silicon Valley motto “fail fast, fail often” took hold because failure was seen as indicative of audacity and a willingness to try. Rejection is a particularly stinging subset of failure, but the principle remains: you took the shot; it didn’t pay off; you try again. , Harry Kane faces big decision, Palace are throwback entertainers and Gary O’Neil shows humility amid success Jack Grealish has stopped falling over. But it’s not just that. Grealish was fouled just twice against Fulham, neither of these the contact-seeking lunges that had for a while become a part of his game. Grealish isn’t necessarily cheating or diving when he does this. The take-the-foul routine is also a way of having your legs battered into a pulp over several years. Grealish carries the ball too well not to be tripped a lot. Contact will happen. Why not manage how that collision works, take the lightest of touches, fall well? But Grealish has started to stay up as well, to use his strength instead to terrorise and bully defenders. He was very good against Fulham, helping to make the opening goal, and just about surviving an ongoing battle with Kenny Tete, who was defending aggressively. Another thing here: the Fulham crowd barracked Grealish and he wagged his finger back at them. But the feeling was less outrage, more pantomime jeers, a kind of semi-buried respect. The other story of Grealish’s season is that he is now surely the most marketable English player in the league; and, grudgingly perhaps for some, one of the most likeable. Barney Ronay Match report: Fulham 1-2 Manchester City Match report: Liverpool 4-3 Tottenham Match report: Manchester United 1-0 Aston Villa , BBC broadcaster is synonymous with the event after more than 20 years as TV’s face of the world snooker championship This year’s World Snooker Championship has produced what some fans of the sport would consider a long overdue wind of change on the baize. Sure, Mark Selby can cement his place in history on bank holiday Monday if he wins the title for a fifth time, but the sight of two players under the age of 30 in Luca Brecel and Si Jiahui playing out a world semi-final felt refreshing if nothing else, given how the sport has been dominated by the same clutch of players for so long. Sports thrive on progression and evolution when it comes to the stars of the show – but away from the action, consistency is a valuable commodity. And for all the change snooker is trying to undergo, there is one bastion of consistency who perhaps never quite gets the credit they truly deserve. In an ever-changing world, nothing screams comforting reassurance like Hazel Irvine presenting the snooker on the BBC. She will utter the first words to the new champion of the world on Monday evening and these days anyone other than Irvine on hand for the biggest moments that matter in snooker feels wrong. , Refreshing response to a question from the media was unlike much of the discourse surrounding elite professional sport Almost certainly fed up while facing the press in the media centre of Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum last Wednesday night, Giannis Antetokounmpo made no attempt to disguise his utter contempt for the query he had just been asked to field. The Bucks basketball legend had fronted up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate after his team’s elimination by the lowly ranked Miami Heat after a five-game series, arguably one of the most seismic upsets in NBA playoff history. Antetokounmpo’s gaze was caught by Eric Nehm, the man from the Athletic on the Bucks beat, who kept his question fairly short and to the point. He had already asked it of Antetokounmpo’s coach and now wished to hear the player’s considered opinion. “Do you view this season as a failure?” A protracted sigh from the top table was followed by an audible groan of “Oh my God”, as Antetokounmpo wearily rubbed his hands up his face and through his hair, in the manner of a man who can’t quite believe the absolute inanity of the question he’s just been asked. Countering with several of his own, rhetorical questions regarding the successes or failures his inquisitor might have enjoyed or endured in his professional life over the past 12 months, he proceeded to expound on his own idea of what constitutes failure, or if there’s even any such thing. “Michael Jordan played 15 years,” he said. “Won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That’s what you’re telling me? I’m asking you a question, yes or no?” , Time will tell who got the best haul of players in Kansas City this year but the already formidable Philly look like they aced the draft once again Philadelphia Eagles. In the past two seasons, the Eagles have given masterclasses in how to execute a perfect draft. The reigning NFC champions have found gold in the south by selecting top-tier players from college football’s best defense. In last year’s draft, the Eagles selected two dominant defensive players, Jordan Davis and Nakobe Dean, both of whom helped the Georgia Bulldogs capture the 2022 national championship. , Project hopes Beatles classic will ‘unite the world’ and show victims of the conflict that they’ll never walk alone An ambitious campaign to create the world’s biggest sing-along as an expression of solidarity with Ukraine during the Eurovision song contest is gaining momentum. The #HelpUkraineSong project is aiming to “unite the world through music” by getting as many people as possible to sing the Beatles’ With a Little Help from My Friends at noon on Saturday 13 May. , Children’s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, urges first minister to put UN protections for under-18s into law Scotland’s outgoing children’s commissioner has warned Humza Yousaf that it will be his “personal failure” if he fails to make good on Nicola Sturgeon’s promise to put international children’s rights standards at the heart of Scottish law. In one of his final interviews before he steps down from the role after six years, Bruce Adamson accused Scottish ministers of “heartbreaking” delays, lack of transparency and “constant broken promises”, after the supreme court ruled that initial attempts at incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law went beyond Holyrood’s powers. , Study of 200,000 Chinese hospital admissions finds acute exposure to air pollution raises risk of heart arrhythmias Spikes in air pollution increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, a large study has found. The research, based on nearly 200,000 hospital admissions in China, found a significant increase in risk of arrhythmias in the first few hours after an increase in air pollution levels. Heart arrhythmias can increase the risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death. , Investors claim sportswear giant failed to minimise their exposure to risk after the rapper and designer’s antisemitic comments led to a sharp decline in the share price Adidas shareholders have filed a class action lawsuit against the sportswear brand, claiming it knew about Kanye West’s problematic behaviour years before it ended their partnership over his antisemitic comments. The shareholders also allege that Adidas failed to mitigate their financial losses or take precautionary measures to minimise their exposure, after the designer and rapper’s erratic behaviour and offensive comments saw him and his Yeezy brand dropped by Adidas, which resulted in a sharp decline in the company’s stock. , Participants who turned in guns were given up to $500 for each firearm at nine program locations throughout the state Thousands of guns were surrendered across New York on Saturday in exchange for gift cards as part of the state’s gun buyback program. According to the New York attorney general, Letitia James, whose office organized the event, more than 3,000 guns including various assault-style rifles and “ghost guns” were given up in what she hailed as a “landmark event”. , Despite the pain of the condition, diagnoses take seven years on average globally.

Yet it took nearly 20 doctors more than 10 years for her to get a diagnosis. “I got an ultrasound every month where they told me it was all clear and I should ‘do yoga’ or ‘get pregnant’,” says Singh. “I have a bone to pick with all of those doctors.” Her experience is not unusual. Globally, it takes seven years on average to get a diagnosis, even though endometriosis is as common as diabetes, affecting one in 10 women. , Wall Street stalwart to buy ‘all deposits and substantially all assets’ of collapsed bank in deal brokered by federal regulators JP Morgan is to acquire most of the collapsing California bank First Republic, in a takeover brokered by regulators as the US races to contain a rash of bank failures with echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis. After weekend talks brokered by regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed that First Republic had collapsed and would be taken over by JP Morgan. , Santiago Peña of the Colorado party is elected, defeating Efraín Alegre who wanted to switch diplomatic recognition to China Paraguay’s ruling party candidate, Santiago Peña, 44, has scored a big win in the presidential election, tightening the conservative Colorado party’s political grip and defusing fears that diplomatic ties with Taiwan might have been cut. Peña, who has pledged to maintain Paraguay’s longstanding Taiwan relations, had 42.7% of the vote with more than 99% of ballots counted – a more than 15-point lead over centre-left rival Efraín Alegre, who has argued for switching allegiance to China. , Ahead of King Charles III’s coronation, prime minister voices support for separating from monarchy but says it is not a priority New Zealand’s prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has said he supports the country becoming a republic but has no immediate plans to act on separation from the monarchy. Hipkins was holding a press conference hours before departing to attend King Charles III’s coronation, when he was asked about the prospect of New Zealand’s independence from the crown. , Reporters say even seemingly innocuous stories are putting them at risk of assault, intimidation and police action under the Digital Security Act Four weeks ago, a reporter in Bangladesh was hauled from his office, badly beaten - and then thrown from the roof of his building, leaving him with fractures in his back, three broken ribs and a machete wound on his head. The journalist, Ayub Meahzi, believes he was targeted for reporting on alleged local government ties to a criminal group. The attack in Chattogram, south-east Bangladesh, has compounded fears of a deterioration in press freedom in the country, which languishes near the bottom of a global press freedom index due to be updated later this week by the group Reporters Sans Frontières. , Over the years, female artists like Georgia O’Keeffe and Hilma af Klint have received scathing reviews. When will women stop being seen as easy targets? In 1993, the reviews for Georgia O’Keeffe’s exhibition at London’s Hayward gallery came in. In the Independent, Andrew Graham-Dixon likened the American artist to a “commercial illustrator” who had “limited talents … but the ambition to be remembered as a Rembrandt”. The Evening Standard’s Brian Sewell said her works were “irredeemably amateur”. William Feaver of the Observer proclaimed that her paintings “made good monthly images on calendars”, while Hilton Kramer’s review in the Sunday Telegraph called her “grossly overrated”, adding that “her great personal beauty played a major role in the myth that now attaches to her name”. Many of these comments are quoted in an article by Beatrix Campbell, published in the Independent in 1993, with the headline: A Woman’s Art That Men Refuse to See. Campbell argued for a more intellectual reading of O’Keeffe – complaining that “national newspaper art critics do not think it necessary to explain or empathise with … or to locate her in the history of American modernism”. This made me think about how so much art criticism is written from a male point of view, and the exceedingly wide gender imbalance that still exists within it. , Our roundup of drama to watch at home includes Panti Bliss’s drag journey, Athol Fugard’s ballroom dreamers and Alain Platel’s nightmarish dance-theatre How very! The sour bubblegum musical inspired by the cult 80s teen movie was filmed during its residency at London’s Other Palace, where they offer karaoke nights and “freeze your brain” cocktails. Make your own slushie and sing along on the sofa as Veronica and JD do some damage. On Icon Film Channel. , The actor’s tale about the creation of a fantasy film captures the humdrum of Hollywood but lacks his on-screen ability to breathe life into characters There is probably a good reason why it is hard to compile a list of decent novels about the making of films (I can think of one, Terry Southern’s Blue Movie): nothing much happens. Or as Tom Hanks observes in this ambitious addition to the genre: “making movies is complicated, maddening, highly technical at times”. Reading it is to be reminded that Hanks, one of the greatest of all movie stars, must have had a good deal of time on his hands during lockdown. Part of its motivation appears to be to give a proper flavour of that truism of movie making: that so much of it is waiting around; three days sitting in a trailer for a minute or two of drama that might end up in a digital suite trash can. This novel, if nothing else, gives you a sense of that experience in real time. Hanks, a famous collector of typewriters, has put them to use once before, in a short story collection that came out in 2017. On that occasion his publisher ventured that “the two-time Oscar winner is as talented a writer as he is an actor”. His screen agent might have had something to say. He writes well enough – there are many artfully constructed scenes here – and what he doesn’t know about the world of this book you’d imagine is not worth knowing; but that quality that he possesses in so much range and depth on screen – the ability to make you care deeply about lives not your own – is quite often elusive on the page. , ...]   \n",
