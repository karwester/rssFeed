The world-building is meticulous, and that world is almost entirely underground. The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don’t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It’s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo’s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right.</p><p>The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive.</p><p>Silo is on Apple TV+ now.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/silo-review-this-rich-dystopian-drama-is-absolutely-thrilling\">Continue reading...</a>   \n",

That’s roughly a £10 ride in an Uber. At 1pm, they will return to Buckingham Palace in their £3.5m gold state coach, again drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. There they will appear on the balcony for a ceremonial flypast.

Sovereign Bodies/Ritual Taxonomy is very much a sound collage in this vein: a jarring sonic montage assembled by Belfast-based composer Jamie Thompson featuring snatches of free jazz, opera, hip-hop, electronica, spoken word and broadcast news. It sounds like someone maniacally dialling between multiple stations on multiple radios.</p><p>Crucially, however, these disparate snippets of music have been specifically recorded for this project. And, as the album progresses, you realise that it is not random or formless, but a virtual audio drama themed around asylum and migration, displacement and assimilation, detention centres and perilous boat journeys. The few male voices here represent bureaucratic authority; the rest are female voices of resistance. The spoken-word poet Felicia Olusanya serves as a kind of narrator; the voice of operatic soprano Amy Ní Fhearraigh is put on to dubplates and manipulated by turntablist Mariam Rezaei; saxophonist Catherine Sikora Mingus howls over a doomy gothic chorale.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/adjunct-ensemble-sovereign-bodies-ritual-taxonomy-review\">Continue reading...</a>   \n",

This book is pitched as an attempt to find a path back to engaging with current affairs without ending up in an ambulance again.</p><p>The good news is that Behr has avoided any further trips to the hospital. The bad news is that he still seems pretty annoyed.

It builds its world meticulously  – and packs plenty of punch Silo, Apple TV+’s 10-part adaptation of the first book in Hugh Howey’s bestselling trilogy of the same name, is not for the claustrophobic. The world-building is meticulous, and that world is almost entirely underground. The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don’t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It’s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo’s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right. The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive. Silo is on Apple TV+ now.    \n",

Now that’s a hostile environment.” When the former UK prime minister is introduced halfway through Lenny Henry’s one-man show about the Windrush scandal, she is swiftly dismissed. It’s one more punchline as Henry holds court with a bountiful supply of jokes, accompanied by near constant reggae. Upon taking the stage as August Henderson he is equal parts standup working the club and party host keeping guests lubricated. Drinks are handed out to the audience from a trolley. We join August at home, Jesus and Bob Marley side by side on the wall of Natalie Pryce’s snug set, as he recounts his 52 years in England since arriving from Jamaica on his mother’s passport aged eight. Before May pops up, there are sparing flash-forwards to the devastating impact of her government’s immigration policy on the Windrush generation. August flinches as CCTV footage of his eventual wrongful detention briefly plays on the back wall. But this story is lighter and more linear than Roy Williams’ powerful contribution to the BBC’s Soon Gone series of Windrush monologues, in which Henry’s character Cyrus was introduced in the grip of confusion, his past and present entwined in a tragic spiral.    \n",

King Dollar, which outperformed in 2022 thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stream of rate hikes, is losing its crown as the central bank approaches the peak of its rate hiking cycle, reducing the allure of the world’s reserve currency.

Still waiting for my invitation to the coronation, I grabbed a ride with a pair of lookalikes – and even made it into Buckingham Palace This Saturday at 10.20am, all eyes will be on King Charles and Camilla as they travel the 1.3 miles from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in their £1.5m Diamond jubilee state coach. That’s roughly a £10 ride in an Uber. At 1pm, they will return to Buckingham Palace in their £3.5m gold state coach, again drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. There they will appear on the balcony for a ceremonial flypast. Or, if you prefer, Channel 4 is showing Frasier, Johnny English Strikes Again and Formula E. What does it feel like knowing half of the world will be settling down with their prosecco and Pringles to gawp at you?

Sovereign Bodies/Ritual Taxonomy is very much a sound collage in this vein: a jarring sonic montage assembled by Belfast-based composer Jamie Thompson featuring snatches of free jazz, opera, hip-hop, electronica, spoken word and broadcast news. It sounds like someone maniacally dialling between multiple stations on multiple radios. Crucially, however, these disparate snippets of music have been specifically recorded for this project. And, as the album progresses, you realise that it is not random or formless, but a virtual audio drama themed around asylum and migration, displacement and assimilation, detention centres and perilous boat journeys. The few male voices here represent bureaucratic authority; the rest are female voices of resistance. The spoken-word poet Felicia Olusanya serves as a kind of narrator; the voice of operatic soprano Amy Ní Fhearraigh is put on to dubplates and manipulated by turntablist Mariam Rezaei; saxophonist Catherine Sikora Mingus howls over a doomy gothic chorale.    \n",

As he was recovering he was told he’d need to avoid stress. Which, as a political columnist for the Guardian, given the state of things, was no easy task. This book is pitched as an attempt to find a path back to engaging with current affairs without ending up in an ambulance again. The good news is that Behr has avoided any further trips to the hospital. The bad news is that he still seems pretty annoyed. Certainly the reader will find their blood pressure rising as the story of politics over the past few years is retold.    \n",

It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” \n",

       "9                       Apple TV+’s adaptation of a novel about a post-apocalyptic, bunker-dwelling civilisation provides an utterly fantastic story. It builds its world meticulously  – and packs plenty of punch Silo, Apple TV+’s 10-part adaptation of the first book in Hugh Howey’s bestselling trilogy of the same name, is not for the claustrophobic. The world-building is meticulous, and that world is almost entirely underground. The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don’t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It’s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo’s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right. The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive. Silo is on Apple TV+ now. \n",

Now that’s a hostile environment.” When the former UK prime minister is introduced halfway through Lenny Henry’s one-man show about the Windrush scandal, she is swiftly dismissed. It’s one more punchline as Henry holds court with a bountiful supply of jokes, accompanied by near constant reggae. Upon taking the stage as August Henderson he is equal parts standup working the club and party host keeping guests lubricated. Drinks are handed out to the audience from a trolley. We join August at home, Jesus and Bob Marley side by side on the wall of Natalie Pryce’s snug set, as he recounts his 52 years in England since arriving from Jamaica on his mother’s passport aged eight. Before May pops up, there are sparing flash-forwards to the devastating impact of her government’s immigration policy on the Windrush generation. August flinches as CCTV footage of his eventual wrongful detention briefly plays on the back wall. But this story is lighter and more linear than Roy Williams’ powerful contribution to the BBC’s Soon Gone series of Windrush monologues, in which Henry’s character Cyrus was introduced in the grip of confusion, his past and present entwined in a tragic spiral. \n",

It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” \n",

The action we’ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity. “Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public. King Dollar, which outperformed in 2022 thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stream of rate hikes, is losing its crown as the central bank approaches the peak of its rate hiking cycle, reducing the allure of the world’s reserve currency. Other currencies including the pound have been benefitting from this shift away from the greenback. Since the nadir last September after the mini-budget which sharply punished sterling, the pound has been on a tear. The US dollar is under pressure against the pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen today as investors expect a weak jobs report stateside later today with 180,000 job creations anticipated in April, the lowest monthly gain since December 2019 before the pandemic. \n",

Still waiting for my invitation to the coronation, I grabbed a ride with a pair of lookalikes – and even made it into Buckingham Palace This Saturday at 10.20am, all eyes will be on King Charles and Camilla as they travel the 1.3 miles from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in their £1.5m Diamond jubilee state coach. That’s roughly a £10 ride in an Uber. At 1pm, they will return to Buckingham Palace in their £3.5m gold state coach, again drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. There they will appear on the balcony for a ceremonial flypast. Or, if you prefer, Channel 4 is showing Frasier, Johnny English Strikes Again and Formula E. What does it feel like knowing half of the world will be settling down with their prosecco and Pringles to gawp at you? There would have to be an administrative error of cataclysmic proportions for me to be accidentally crowned king, or even to share part of the big day with him. But I can find out what it’s like to be part of the royal fuss. Bafta-winning film-maker, artist and photographer Alison Jackson – famous for shooting a fake Diana flicking the Vs, a fake Queen drinking tea in bed and a fake Donald Trump partying with the KKK – has organised a phoney coronation complete with Charles and Camilla lookalikes and horse-drawn carriage. And it turns out that she needs a footman to open carriage doors and light Camilla’s fags. What can possibly go wrong? \n",

Sovereign Bodies/Ritual Taxonomy is very much a sound collage in this vein: a jarring sonic montage assembled by Belfast-based composer Jamie Thompson featuring snatches of free jazz, opera, hip-hop, electronica, spoken word and broadcast news. It sounds like someone maniacally dialling between multiple stations on multiple radios. Crucially, however, these disparate snippets of music have been specifically recorded for this project. And, as the album progresses, you realise that it is not random or formless, but a virtual audio drama themed around asylum and migration, displacement and assimilation, detention centres and perilous boat journeys. The few male voices here represent bureaucratic authority; the rest are female voices of resistance. The spoken-word poet Felicia Olusanya serves as a kind of narrator; the voice of operatic soprano Amy Ní Fhearraigh is put on to dubplates and manipulated by turntablist Mariam Rezaei; saxophonist Catherine Sikora Mingus howls over a doomy gothic chorale. \n",

As he was recovering he was told he’d need to avoid stress. Which, as a political columnist for the Guardian, given the state of things, was no easy task. This book is pitched as an attempt to find a path back to engaging with current affairs without ending up in an ambulance again. The good news is that Behr has avoided any further trips to the hospital. The bad news is that he still seems pretty annoyed. Certainly the reader will find their blood pressure rising as the story of politics over the past few years is retold. \n",

Kwarteng’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the mini-budget, helping the pound to recover. Valero, a senior policy fellow at London School of Economics’s Centre for Economic Performance, warned that using tax cuts as a “quick fix” to boost growth wouldn’t work and called for more generous incentives to spur business investment. The remarks underscore the competing demands Hunt faces if he finds money for giveaways ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024. He’s facing pressure from the ruling Conservative Party to reduce the tax burden, which is the highest it’s been in decades. “IAG has delivered its first Q1 profit since 2019, confirming the departure from the tricky Covid period. Trading was strong aided by the twin forces of lower fuel prices and strong demand; however, some credit is also due to IAG’s own actions and focus on core North American and Latin American markets. Going forward, the company recognises that there may be headwinds but improved profitability and the ability to lower debt should put it in a robust position.” \n",

It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” , Arrest follows hunt for shooter who fired automatic weapon from moving vehicle in town south of Belgrade A suspect has been arrested after at least eight people were killed and 13 injured in a second mass shooting in Serbia in as many days.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup , Apple TV+’s adaptation of a novel about a post-apocalyptic, bunker-dwelling civilisation provides an utterly fantastic story. It builds its world meticulously  – and packs plenty of punch Silo, Apple TV+’s 10-part adaptation of the first book in Hugh Howey’s bestselling trilogy of the same name, is not for the claustrophobic. The world-building is meticulous, and that world is almost entirely underground. The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don’t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It’s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo’s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right. The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive. Silo is on Apple TV+ now. , Bush theatre, LondonThe actor makes his debut as a playwright with a richly detailed character study, performing with warm humour and outrage at injustice ‘Have you seen Theresa May dance? Now that’s a hostile environment.” When the former UK prime minister is introduced halfway through Lenny Henry’s one-man show about the Windrush scandal, she is swiftly dismissed. It’s one more punchline as Henry holds court with a bountiful supply of jokes, accompanied by near constant reggae. Upon taking the stage as August Henderson he is equal parts standup working the club and party host keeping guests lubricated. Drinks are handed out to the audience from a trolley. We join August at home, Jesus and Bob Marley side by side on the wall of Natalie Pryce’s snug set, as he recounts his 52 years in England since arriving from Jamaica on his mother’s passport aged eight. Before May pops up, there are sparing flash-forwards to the devastating impact of her government’s immigration policy on the Windrush generation. August flinches as CCTV footage of his eventual wrongful detention briefly plays on the back wall. But this story is lighter and more linear than Roy Williams’ powerful contribution to the BBC’s Soon Gone series of Windrush monologues, in which Henry’s character Cyrus was introduced in the grip of confusion, his past and present entwined in a tragic spiral. , Labour gains Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent with results still coming in for 230 councils in England, plus four mayoral races  Live results tracker Prof Rob Ford, an elections specialist, has written an article for the Guardian trying to assess what would be a good result and a bad result for the political parties in the local election.

Twenty-two schools and universities across the continent have been occupied as part of a proposed month-long campaign. In Germany, universities were occupied in Wolfenbüttel, Magdeburg, Münster, Bielefeld, Regensburg, Bremen and Berlin. In Spain, students in occupation at the Autonomous University of Barcelona organised teach-outs on climate change. In Belgium, 40 students occupied the University of Ghent. In the Czech republic, about 100 students camped outside the ministry of trade and industry. And in the UK occupations were under way at the universities of Leeds, Exeter and Falmouth. , Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as sterling rallies over $1.26  Trading halted in shares of two more US lenders as fears of banking crisis mount Britain’s financial watchdog has continued its crackdown on illegally operated crypto ATMs. The Financial Conduct Authority has inspected sites in Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield, in its pushback against machines allowing customers to buy or convert traditional currencies into cryptoassets including bitcoin. “Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. The action we’ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity. “Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public. King Dollar, which outperformed in 2022 thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stream of rate hikes, is losing its crown as the central bank approaches the peak of its rate hiking cycle, reducing the allure of the world’s reserve currency. Other currencies including the pound have been benefitting from this shift away from the greenback. Since the nadir last September after the mini-budget which sharply punished sterling, the pound has been on a tear. The US dollar is under pressure against the pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen today as investors expect a weak jobs report stateside later today with 180,000 job creations anticipated in April, the lowest monthly gain since December 2019 before the pandemic. , What’s it like to share a carriage with Charles and Camilla? Still waiting for my invitation to the coronation, I grabbed a ride with a pair of lookalikes – and even made it into Buckingham Palace This Saturday at 10.20am, all eyes will be on King Charles and Camilla as they travel the 1.3 miles from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in their £1.5m Diamond jubilee state coach. That’s roughly a £10 ride in an Uber. At 1pm, they will return to Buckingham Palace in their £3.5m gold state coach, again drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. There they will appear on the balcony for a ceremonial flypast. Or, if you prefer, Channel 4 is showing Frasier, Johnny English Strikes Again and Formula E. What does it feel like knowing half of the world will be settling down with their prosecco and Pringles to gawp at you? There would have to be an administrative error of cataclysmic proportions for me to be accidentally crowned king, or even to share part of the big day with him. But I can find out what it’s like to be part of the royal fuss. Bafta-winning film-maker, artist and photographer Alison Jackson – famous for shooting a fake Diana flicking the Vs, a fake Queen drinking tea in bed and a fake Donald Trump partying with the KKK – has organised a phoney coronation complete with Charles and Camilla lookalikes and horse-drawn carriage. And it turns out that she needs a footman to open carriage doors and light Camilla’s fags. What can possibly go wrong? , Mohamed Nur, of south-west London, charged with murder and possession of offensive weapon, police say A man has been charged with the murder of the stabbing victim Johanita Dogbey as well as offences connected to alleged knife attacks two days earlier. Mohamed Nur, 33, of Bond Way, south-west London, was charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon, the Metropolitan police said. , (Diatribe Records)Free jazz, opera, hymns, punk and newscasts intermingle in an oddly compelling sonic collage addressing issues of asylum and migration Anyone who has heard the Beatles’ Revolution No 9 will be familiar with musique concrète: a compositional style based around the manipulation of existing recordings and found sounds, one pioneered by the likes of Pierre Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Sovereign Bodies/Ritual Taxonomy is very much a sound collage in this vein: a jarring sonic montage assembled by Belfast-based composer Jamie Thompson featuring snatches of free jazz, opera, hip-hop, electronica, spoken word and broadcast news. It sounds like someone maniacally dialling between multiple stations on multiple radios. Crucially, however, these disparate snippets of music have been specifically recorded for this project. And, as the album progresses, you realise that it is not random or formless, but a virtual audio drama themed around asylum and migration, displacement and assimilation, detention centres and perilous boat journeys. The few male voices here represent bureaucratic authority; the rest are female voices of resistance. The spoken-word poet Felicia Olusanya serves as a kind of narrator; the voice of operatic soprano Amy Ní Fhearraigh is put on to dubplates and manipulated by turntablist Mariam Rezaei; saxophonist Catherine Sikora Mingus howls over a doomy gothic chorale. , The Back to the Future star is funny, engaging and incredibly candid about living with Parkinson’s. Plus the classic tale of the girl who moves things with her mind , A heart attack prompts the Guardian journalist to investigate the underlying causes of our uniquely polarised moment On the last day of 2019 Rafael Behr had a heart attack, a really bad one, the kind known as a “widowmaker”. As he was recovering he was told he’d need to avoid stress. Which, as a political columnist for the Guardian, given the state of things, was no easy task. This book is pitched as an attempt to find a path back to engaging with current affairs without ending up in an ambulance again. The good news is that Behr has avoided any further trips to the hospital. The bad news is that he still seems pretty annoyed. Certainly the reader will find their blood pressure rising as the story of politics over the past few years is retold. , In this week’s newsletter: Despite enthusiasm for the monarchy sinking to a reported low, apparently Britain can’t get enough of King Charles tat  Don’t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox? Sign up here While a recent poll by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) showed public support for the monarchy has fallen to a historic low, the booming sales of coronation merch perhaps begs to differ. On Saturday, a new British monarch will be crowned for the first time in 70 years, and retailers have been quick to churn out limited edition pieces to celebrate King Charles. , Labour gains Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent with results still coming in for 230 councils in England, plus four mayoral races  Live results tracker Prof Rob Ford, an elections specialist, has written an article for the Guardian trying to assess what would be a good result and a bad result for the political parties in the local election.  Results from more than 60 councils are expected overnight with the remainder expected to trickle in throughout the day on Friday. , Keir Starmer’s party takes control of key council targets including Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent  England local elections – latest updates Labour has said it is on track to win the next election, after taking control of key councils in the English local elections, including Medway, Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent. Based on results counted early on Friday morning, the party said it was heading for a result that if repeated across the country at a general election would give them an eight-point lead over the Conservatives. , Russian foreign minister reiterates Kremlin claim that Moscow drone incident was a ‘terrorist attack’ What we know on day 436 of the invasion The UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update that “a recent uptick in Russian rail accidents in areas bordering Ukraine, attributed to sabotage committed by unknown actors, has almost certainly caused short-term localised disruption to Russian military rail movements”. It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” , Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as sterling rallies over $1.26  Trading halted in shares of two more US lenders as fears of banking crisis mount Last September, the pound hit its alltime low against the US dollar after then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget, and promised more were on the way. Kwarteng’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the mini-budget, helping the pound to recover. Valero, a senior policy fellow at London School of Economics’s Centre for Economic Performance, warned that using tax cuts as a “quick fix” to boost growth wouldn’t work and called for more generous incentives to spur business investment. The remarks underscore the competing demands Hunt faces if he finds money for giveaways ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024. He’s facing pressure from the ruling Conservative Party to reduce the tax burden, which is the highest it’s been in decades. “IAG has delivered its first Q1 profit since 2019, confirming the departure from the tricky Covid period. Trading was strong aided by the twin forces of lower fuel prices and strong demand; however, some credit is also due to IAG’s own actions and focus on core North American and Latin American markets. Going forward, the company recognises that there may be headwinds but improved profitability and the ability to lower debt should put it in a robust position.” , IAG expects to fly almost the same passenger numbers this year as before Covid pandemic The owner of British Airways has upgraded its full-year profit expectations thanks to strong demand for holiday travel, as the airline group said it expected to fly almost the same number of passengers this year as it did before the coronavirus pandemic. International Airlines Group (IAG) reported a first-quarter profit for the first time since 2019, before the travel industry was plunged into chaos by Covid lockdowns. It made an operating profit of €9m (£7.9m) in the first three months of the year. , Labour gains Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent with results still coming in for 230 councils in England, plus four mayoral races  Live results tracker Prof Rob Ford, an elections specialist, has written an article for the Guardian trying to assess what would be a good result and a bad result for the political parties in the local election.

In early results, the Lib Dems defeated the Conservatives to win control of Windsor and Maidenhead council, Theresa May’s home territory. , Former US president said Putin disavowed Yeltsin deal over Ukraine; Ukrainian air force downed own drone after it lost control over Kyiv  What we know on day 436 of the invasion The UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update that “a recent uptick in Russian rail accidents in areas bordering Ukraine, attributed to sabotage committed by unknown actors, has almost certainly caused short-term localised disruption to Russian military rail movements”. It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” , Former US president said Putin disavowed Yeltsin deal over Ukraine; Ukrainian air force downed own drone after it lost control over Kyiv  What we know on day 436 of the invasion The UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update that “a recent uptick in Russian rail accidents in areas bordering Ukraine, attributed to sabotage committed by unknown actors, has almost certainly caused short-term localised disruption to Russian military rail movements”.

Results from more than 60 councils are expected overnight with the remainder expected to trickle in throughout the day on Friday. , Keir Starmer’s party takes control of key council targets including Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent  England local elections – latest updates Labour has said it is on track to win the next election, after taking control of key councils in the English local elections, including Medway, Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent. Based on results counted early on Friday morning, the party said it was heading for a result that if repeated across the country at a general election would give them an eight-point lead over the Conservatives. , If you are a Conservative MP worried about the next general election, the results thus far will cause alarm  England local elections – latest updates More or less every time you turned on the radio or opened a newspaper in recent days a government minister was there, warning gloomily of a “tough night” for the Conservatives in the local elections. They were not wrong. But just how tough is the big question to come for Rishi Sunak. Divining UK-wide political lessons from early results in low-turnout elections from an arbitrary selection of areas across only England is, of course, hugely difficult, which is where the work of the party media spinners comes in. , As the results come in, find out how Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems and other parties fared in Thursday’s polls for hundreds of English councils  Latest reporting and analysis About these elections On 4 May, 230 English councils are holding elections with more than 8,000 seats being contested. Some are for metropolitan boroughs such as Liverpool city council and others for unitary authorities such as Herefordshire or North Somerset. Both structures are single-tier authorities with responsibility for the whole range of council services, including education, social care, rubbish collection and parks. , Two-year study by Nuffield Trust and LSE says successive governments failed to make social care a priority Distress and heartbreak for millions could have been avoided if the government had not missed opportunities to prepare social care for a pandemic, according to a big investigation into how the first wave of Covid hit care homes. A review of events in spring 2020, when almost 20,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales, found it was the result of “letting one of our most important public services languish in constant crisis for years”. The government excluded social care from pandemic-planning exercises such as Exercise Alice and after problems were identified by Exercise Cygnus, which did include the sector, action was not taken. Social care leaders felt invisible at the start of the pandemic because there had been no dedicated director general for social care in government since 2016. No adult social care representatives sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and people leading the UK pandemic response lacked “deep understanding” of social care. , GPs say trans people being put at risk by lack of evidence on how to assess them by gender-based metrics A host of algorithms used by medics to assess disease risk and help make decisions on treatment are failing to take transgender patients into account, doctors have said. Many metrics and thresholds in medicine, including ideal body weight, alcohol clearance rates, kidney function and risk of cardiovascular disease vary by gender. , Calls follow release of account by captain who said he strongly warned against ‘folly’ of attempted landing in June 1982 The release of a witness account detailing the “folly” of an operation in which 56 service personnel died on ships off the Falkland islands – the deadliest day for the British military since 1945 – has prompted fresh calls for the government to unseal all files relating to the tragedy. Attacks by Argentinian Skyhawk planes against the landing ships Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad killed dozens of service personnel on 8 June 1982 and left more than 150 injured, including Simon Weston, the Welsh guard whose disfigured face became a defining image of the conflict. , Police searching for attacker who fired automatic weapon from a moving vehicle in town south of Belgrade, injuring a further 13 At least eight people have been killed and 13 injured in Serbia in a series of shootings south of Belgrade, state-run media has reported, just one day after a school shooting also saw nine killed in the capital. The shootings started late on Thursday near the town of Mladenovac when an attacker opened fire with an automatic weapon from a moving vehicle and then fled, state broadcaster RTS television reported. Seven of the injured are in a critical condition. , Rightmove says rise due to higher home loan rates and record asking prices for properties New first-time buyers are typically paying nearly £200 a month more on their mortgage than a year ago because of a combination of higher home loan rates and record asking prices for properties, new data shows. The figures from property website Rightmove underline the challenging conditions facing those hoping to get on to the UK housing ladder, with separate figures this week indicating that house prices have resumed their upwards march at the same time that average rents are hitting fresh highs. , Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news  Trading halted in shares of two more US lenders as fears of banking crisis mount Stocks have opened higher in London, as share claw back some of yesterday’s losses. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has gained 58 points, or 0.75%, back to 7760 points, away from Thursday’s one-month low. “IAG has delivered its first Q1 profit since 2019, confirming the departure from the tricky Covid period. Trading was strong aided by the twin forces of lower fuel prices and strong demand; however, some credit is also due to IAG’s own actions and focus on core North American and Latin American markets. Going forward, the company recognises that there may be headwinds but improved profitability and the ability to lower debt should put it in a robust position.” , Broadcaster and friend calls  invitation to pay allegiance  ‘well-intentioned and rather ill-advised’ King Charles finds the idea of people paying homage to him “abhorrent”, his friend Jonathan Dimbleby has said while seeking to pin the blame for the proposal on the archbishop of Canterbury. There has been a widespread backlash against the idea of a “homage of the people”, in which the general public is invited to swear allegiance to the king during the coronation on Saturday. , Re-edited version omits opening scene after claims of fatphobia and replaces original on ABC and BBC platforms  Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast The ABC has removed part of a Bluey episode that sparked accusations of fat-shaming and fatphobia.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup , H5N1 bird flu may lead to extinction of species as data revealed by Guardian shows worst losses in decades Avian flu has killed more than twice the number of wild birds previously estimated in the UK, according to data collected by the Guardian, with numbers likely to escalate during this year’s breeding season. The highly infectious variant of H5N1 has caused Europe’s worst bird flu outbreak, resulting in the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades. Conservationists are warning that it could mean the extinction of some seabird species, as breeding colonies have been particularly badly hit. , Elizabeth’s crowning seemed like a new dawn. But the reign of Charles begins in a kingdom under a cloud No one under the age of 75 can have anything but the haziest memory of the last time we did this. Britain has not witnessed a coronation since 1953, and even those who remember the crowning of Elizabeth II will have little to guide them. We are a different country now, and Charles a very different prospective monarch – if only because of one simple, unavoidable fact: he is an old king. Start not with him, but with us. The Britain of 1953 would scarcely recognise itself in the Britain of 2023. Obviously the entire world has transformed. Ask someone who recalls the last coronation and they’ll soon tell you about the novel thrill of seeing the ceremony on live television, perhaps at the home of a neighbour who was the one person on the street lucky enough to own a “set”. Today, almost every one of us has a supercomputer in our pocket, complete with a screen able to carry live colour pictures from anywhere on Earth – or even of a distant planet. , Despite gestures towards inclusivity, the ceremony remains rooted in outdated religious and feudal ideals At the heart of the coronation of Charles III on Saturday is a very deliberate national deception about religion. In some ways, the deception hides in plain sight, not attracting attention. Pre-coronation speculation has focused instead on more trivial things – Camilla, Harry, Meghan – or on monarchy’s general popularity in the post-Elizabeth era. But when you watch and listen to the coronation itself, the religious deception will be hard to miss – and harder to believe. Many will instinctively want to be generous about the coronation and will not want to spoil the party. In that spirit, they might call this weekend’s ritual a historical pretence that pleases many and does no particular harm. If they were being stronger-minded, as they ought to be about an event that inevitably says so much about this country to itself and the world, they could instead call the ritual what it is: a lie at the heart of the British state. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist , From conflict at George IV’s crowning to Charles III’s downsized audience, the ceremony is a constant reinvention King Charles’s coronation will put the thousand-year history of the British monarchy on display, but the royal family’s pomp and circumstance is not as historic as it might appear. In 1953, for example, the royals had to borrow extra horse-drawn carriages from a film company for Elizabeth II’s coronation. Sir David Cannadine, a historian and author of The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, has written about the reinvention of coronation traditions over the centuries. , Australian Jake Smith’s collection, including an 1845 menu for the king of Hanover, shows some dishes favoured by previous British monarchs that are definitely not on King Charles’s menu In a time before coronation quiches, a new monarch might diligently work through dozens of courses. They might slurp through a turtle soup or pheasant consommé or brave a maupygernon – which one UK MP described as a grim recipe “based on hogs’ kidneys and flavoured with ingredients suggesting the witches’ cauldron in Macbeth”. , The Oscar-winning actor is back for the Book Club sequel. But what she really wants to talk about is big cars, her love for Woody Allen – and her unexpected passion Even before her dog almost dies, my call with Diane Keaton is chaotic. There’s a delay on the line. Conversation stops and starts like a milk float. I’d emailed questions but she hasn’t read them. She wants to talk about doors. Every answer comes stacked with caveats. It’s fun and stressful – and smart. She wants to escape her own interview. Now 77, Hollywood’s most self-effacing star doesn’t do video calls. Neither does her character in the Book Club films, the latest of which starts with her struggling to speak via her laptop to best friends played by Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen. , Sections of industry back synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels, but case is much stronger for aviation Most bright red sports cars do not make much of their green credentials. Yet a test run in Bicester, Oxfordshire, by the startup Zero Petroleum last month gave a glimpse of a future in which combustion engines did not add new carbon to the atmosphere. The car was running on e-fuel: petrol made using electricity, hydrogen from water, and carbon captured from the air. The automotive industry is steadily moving away from fossil fuels, and a firm global consensus has emerged that battery electric vehicles are the way forward. Yet that consensus took a knock in March when the EU – to the shock of energy experts, environmental campaigners and much of the car industry – opened a small back door to e-fuels. , People who sought route to Europe before fighting erupted in Khartoum speak of police brutality, torture and homelessness Ever since fighting erupted in his home town of Nyala, the state capital of South Darfur in Sudan, in mid-April, Khaled’s mobile phone has not stopped ringing. Family members, friends and acquaintances want to know how to reach north Africa and which country is best for departing for Europe. The 17-year-old, currently living in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, wishes he could tell them that the journey is simple and that countries like Tunisia and Libya are welcoming and safe. , With more bank holidays on the way, these properties should give you space to entertain friends and family , Long synonymous with cheesy pop and earnest ballads, the song contest is also now home to bombastic metal. Past rockers and 2023 contestants explain why they’re actually a perfect fit Mention Eurovision and most people will instantly think of Abba’s Waterloo, or the sight of Céline Dion singing Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi in her widest-shouldered blazer. The contest is notorious for thrusting the cheesiest, most bombastic pop it can find into 180 million people’s living rooms every May, and most of the artists playing 2023’s edition in Liverpool on 13 May will cleave to one of two formulas: Europop bangers, or earnest ballads delivered with beseeching, outstretched arms. Yet since the turn of the century, Eurovision’s love for singalong anthems and OTT theatre has unintentionally made it perfect for a genre that positions itself as pop’s polar opposite: heavy metal. The genre has employed larger-than-life drama ever since Iron Maiden started taking a 10ft-tall zombie on tour; even the most satanic black metal heretics often take to the stage in facepaint. And so nearly every Eurovision throws up a ferocious metal curveball, the most famous being the orc-cosplaying Lordi who won for Finland in 2006 with Hard Rock Hallelujah. Other memorable performances include those by Icelandic electro-goth BDSM troupe Hatari in 2019, bare-chested Finns Teräsbetoni in 2008, and Eldrine, an Evanescence-esque Georgian band in 2011. , The cries of gulls serenade our tipsters as they promenade past funfairs, stripy beach huts and ice-cream shops from Cornwall to Aberdeen. Scroll down for the winning tip and to send in your own Rame peninsula. Tiny beach, endless sea. There’s a seafront pub right there in Kingsand, the Devonport, just up the steps, serving delicious food – or you can just sit outside and look at the sunset. We went to Kingsand for our very first holiday together, my then-lover and I. I booked at short notice – the guesthouse we stayed in has since been put up for sale. We played guitar on the beach and got roped into a sea shanty singalong with the locals. We went back about 10 years later – same beach, same gorgeous yellow house on the beach, same pub. Children were playing on the beach who wouldn’t have been born yet when we had last come. It was special.Ewa Szypula , Hugo hates lying on all the crumbs, but for Harriet it’s the perfect place to eat.

This is daily life for Chris and his family, who own a 486-hectare (1,200-acre) farm, and for the other 14 homes in the upper Coquet valley in Northumberland national park. The noisy generator and toxic fumes are in stark contrast to the tranquil and picturesque hills of one of the most beautiful landscapes in the UK. Katherine Singer points to her neighbour’s house in the distance approximately a mile away. The homes of the valley are few and far between, adding to the remoteness of the area. , Blume’s groundbreaking books shepherded me and millions of others through the trials of adolescence – and they’re still as relevant as ever It is a truth universally acknowledged that being a teenage girl sucks. Struggling with a changing body, navigating the schoolyard hierarchies, feeling disconnected from your parents, being sexualised in ways you are both ready and not ready for – like most of my peers, I went through the wringer between the ages of 12 and 18. When I look at my six-year-old daughter now, I worry about what she’ll have to face in the hormone trenches – but I’m comforted that, like me, she’ll have Judy Blume. , All hail the nature arbitrary of privilege that’s hereditary  Sign up here to get an email whenever First Dog cartoons are published Get all your needs met at the First Dog shop if what you need is First Dog merchandise and prints , The British boxer will be a huge underdog on the champion’s home turf but he is promising the crowd a fight to remember John Ryder’s boyhood dream was to be a firefighter and on Saturday night he may need to draw on that hazy past to fight the blazing inferno that could engulf him when he steps into the ring against Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez in Guadalajara. Canelo, the flame-haired Mexican boxing legend, remains the most popular fighter in the world and this defence of his undisputed world super-middleweight title is his first bout in his home country since November 2011. Mexico will be in a fever all week, especially in the teeming city of Guadalajara, 20 miles from where the boxer grew up in Juanacatlán. Ryder, the aspiring fire-fighter, grew up on Upper Street in Islington, which will seem a very long way away in the final hours before he faces the might and fury of Canelo in front of a fiery crowd of 48,000 at the Estadio Akron. , In the aftermath of the sprinter’s death at the age of just 32, her USA teammate remembers a talented athlete who did things her own way The post-race glory photo-op is a time honored tradition, an occasion for athletes to get their hit of global adulation in case their compatriot fans forget to tune in to the medal ceremony. Tori Bowie never looked more resplendent than she was in a snapshot of USA’s 4x100m women’s team after their remarkable triumph at the 2016 Olympics. Interlocked with Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tianna Bartoletta in a postcard for #blackgirlmagic, Bowie served a little bit of everything on that hot and sticky evening at João Havelange Stadium on the penultimate night of the Games. She flexed serious power with those washboard abs and flashed pops of color with her fuchsia headband – a silken cousin to the bonnets many Black women use to preserve their locks. But instead of wearing it to bed, Bowie wore hers on the world’s biggest stage. Gardner says that was typical of Bowie: “never what the world asked for, always unapologetically her”. , Former amateurs have risen from obscurity and hired Owen Coyle but there are questions over funding and sustainability Depending on one’s outlook, Friday evening in the unlikely surroundings of Ochilview Park could either see a Scottish football fairytale come to life or the latest temporary vindication of the boom-or-bust culture that has scarred the game in the past. Queen’s Park, who were amateurs for more than a century and proud of it, will earn a place in the top flight as a professional team if they defeat Dundee. But for an Arsenal-esque stumble – Queen’s have won one of their past six games – promotion would already have been secured. Sixty-five years have passed since Queen’s, formed in 1867 and Scotland’s oldest league club, played top-division football. In those more simple times of 1957-58, Hearts secured the title at a canter from the Old Firm as The Spiders won four matches out of 34. In the intervening decades Queen’s have generally floated around the nether regions of Scotland’s league structure. They were a cuddly club, untouched by the corporate classes. , UN children’s agency welcomes drop in number of underage brides, but warns 12 million girls still getting married each year The number of child marriages is declining worldwide, but at too slow a pace for any hope of eliminating the practice this century, Unicef, the UN children’s agency, has said. In a new report, Unicef tentatively welcomed the reduction but warned that it was nowhere close to meeting its sustainable development goal of ridding the world of the practice by 2030. , Neely, 30, whose subway death was ruled a homicide by New York’s medical examiner, remembered as kind and loving Jordan Neely had a fan club. The 30-year-old Michael Jackson impersonator had amassed a following within New York City and beyond, with thousands online admiring the young man’s aptitude for dance and creating a Facebook group to share his performances. , Arizona high court found no evidence of the failed gubernatorial candidate’s claim of 35,000 fraudulent votes in election Lawyers for Kari Lake, the failed Republican gubernatorial candidate, were sanctioned $2,000 on Thursday by the Arizona supreme court in their unsuccessful challenge of her defeat in the governor’s race last year to Democrat Katie Hobbs. In an order, the state’s highest court said Lake’s attorney made “false factual statements” that more than 35,000 ballots had been improperly added to the total ballot count, imposing 10 days to submit payment. , A post 9/11 murder mystery from the makers of Gossip Girl, and the Fab Five are back to sprinkle their makeover magic on New Orleans. Plus: The Muppets Mayhem , Hilarity ensues when two laid-back community support officers are asked to infiltrate a drug gang. Plus: the Prince of Bel-Air reboot rolls on. Here’s what to watch this evening , (Captured Tracks)With their classic late-60s songwriting and beautiful harmonies, the New York duo have never mined the past more effectively than on this fourth album  Musical pastiche can be dangerous. When you go beyond having influences to embodying those influences, artists can easily slip into self-parody. You need spectacularly good songs to pull it off. The Lemon Twigs, a US duo who have often been dangerously close to mere cosplay – perpetually caught in a time vortex where they get sent back to 1967 every time they reach 1976 – have managed it with historic aplomb on their fourth album. The biggest touchstone is the beautifully harmonised existential dread of the Beach Boys post-Pet Sounds flop era: rarely has stark despair (one song is called Every Day Is the Worst Day of My Life) sounded so lovely. There’s also pre-disco Bee Gees, Byrds psych-pop, Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel and James Taylor’s sturdy craft, and a touch of classic rock on What You Were Doing (which also recalls Teenage Fanclub, and their own harking back). , The Suede bassist’s alternative-history romp through the theatres and over the rooftops of Elizabethan London is full of charm and vigour The Ghost Theatre begins with a London rooftop chase worthy of Mission: Impossible. Our young heroine, Shay, hurtles above Eastcheap and St Peter’s Hill, St Paul’s Church a landmark in the near distance. “She came down with a crash, sending a flock of pigeons skywards in a soft explosion of feathers. They spread like a fountain and she repeated the catechism under her breath: The gods are birds and the birds are gods. She let its cadence guide her feet. The gods – step – are birds – step – and the birds – step – are gods – leap.” In his debut, 2020’s The Ruins, Mat Osman proved himself to be a vivid and imaginative writer. That was the story of two brothers, a 21st-century tale of murder and mystery that embraced the fantastical as it moved through London, Los Angeles, Las Vegas. It was published just before the first Covid lockdown, when our collective attention was understandably elsewhere. But Osman, bassist and founding member of the British band Suede, knows something about perseverance. His second novel is another wild ride, a vigorous adventure that reinforces the sense of an author with energy and wit to spare. , Who said the floral midi-dress was dead? Put a spring in your step with our pick to buy, rent or thrift Pink, £32.99, zara.com , Charles III will be crowned in Westminster Abbey on Saturday in a ceremony steeped in centuries of history. Jonathan Freedland examines what the event means to the modern-day UK In a ceremony on Saturday steeped in history, King Charles III will finally receive the crown. At 74 years old, he will be the oldest monarch ever to take the throne. At the same age, his mother was gearing up for her golden jubilee. And as the Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland tells Maeve McClenaghan, this means there will be a very different tone from the last coronation. Rather than a country crowning a young queen who was virtually unknown as a public figure, Charles’s views on everything from architecture to ecology have been widely aired. And his reign will be as an old man. , Looking at the health problems caused by air pollution, poorer communities have most to gain Clean-air or low-emission zones are being rolled out in more UK cities, and the London mayor is proposing to extend the ultra-low emission zone to the suburbs. These zones are designed to speed up the attainment of legal limits for air pollution and to lessen the health burden from breathing poor air. While not new, such zones can be controversial, especially when they are introduced or expanded. , The best of this week’s wildlife photographs, including rescued turtles, a fox cub and Pablo Escobar’s hippos ]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[The trio attended Bruce Springsteen’s concert and made a last-minute dinner reservation at the Palace Hotel’s Amar restaurant Staff at a Barcelona restaurant were left amazed when a mysterious last-minute booking turned out to be for the former US president Barack Obama along with film director Steven Spielberg and singer Bruce Springsteen. After dining on Thursday evening at the Palace Hotel’s Amar restaurant, the trio posed for a photograph with employees. The picture was posted on Instagram by staff member Pol Perello and captioned: “Pleasures that this job brings you!!” ,  Qatari banker offers around £5bn for 100% of club Interested parties needed to make offers by 10pm BST on Friday Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have lodged final bids for Manchester United by Friday’s 10pm BST deadline. The offers are markedly less than the £6bn valuation of the club’s owners, the Glazers. Sheikh Jassim, a Qatari banker, remains intent on purchasing 100% of the club but will not pay more than what he believes United are worth. The Guardian understands this is around £5bn, roughly £1bn below the American family’s asking price. ,  Si leads 14-10 after one of the best sessions ever seen Mark Selby leads Mark Allen 7-6 in gruelling semi-final Luca Brecel staged a brave fightback to stay in his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Si Jiahui in one of the most exciting sessions witnessed at the Crucible. The Chinese world No 80, who has wowed fans over the last two weeks with his brilliant attacking game, looked on course to win the match with a session to spare when he won the first three frames of the evening session, extending his lead from 11-5 to 14-5 with breaks of 90, 132 and 97. ,  Bochum 1-1 Borussia Dortmund Bayern Munich will go top if they beat Hertha Berlin on Sunday The Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund’s title chances suffered a serious blow on Friday after they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at struggling Bochum. Dortmund are on 61 points with four matches remaining, two points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich, who will move top if they beat bottom club Hertha Berlin on Sunday. , Colombian author’s En Agosto Now Vemos (We’ll See Each Other in August) had been just a rumour but now fans will get to read it Rumours had long circulated that an entire literary masterpiece, never seen by the public, could still be lying in a dusty safe held by the late author’s family or under lock and key at his archive at the University of Texas. On Friday Penguin Random House confirmed that an unpublished Gabriel García Márquez novel – titled En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We’ll See Each Other in August) – not only exists, but will be on shelves across Latin America in 2024. , Tree design includes names of Commonwealth nations, and poles are made from tree from Windsor estate The king and the queen consort will be anointed behind a specially created screen of fine embroidery, held by poles hewn from an ancient windblown Windsor oak and mounted with eagles cast in bronze and gilded in gold leaf, Buckingham Palace has announced. The anointing screen has been blessed at a special service at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, and will be used at what historically has been viewed as the most sacred moment of the coronation. , Wikimedia UK says it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill Wikipedia could be made inaccessible to UK readers due to issues over complying with the online safety bill, a charity affiliated with the website has warned. Lucy Crompton-Reid, the chief executive of Wikimedia UK, warned the popular site could be blocked because it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill. , Scotland’s Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has been asked to look into the killing of Glasgow teacher  Scotland’s police watchdog has been ordered to launch an investigation into the murder of a pregnant teacher in Glasgow after finding the body of her fiance in a reservoir days later. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said it had been instructed to carry out the probe after the death of Marelle Sturrock, who was found at her home on Tuesday. , The former striker discusses visiting hospitals in his homeland, his push to raise funds and Champions League hopes for Milan “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. , Forty-year-old festival sees chefs use power tools to mix the eggs before a fork lift hoists the enormous frying pan into place Using 8,400 eggs, 25kg of venison sausage and 14 bottles of salt and pepper, New Caledonia’s giant omelette festival aims to bring people together in a region that is often divided. “It is important to have festivals like this. The giant omelette is a symbol of sharing,” says veteran chef Reine Chenot. , Twickenham is expected to host over 53,000 fans as England’s departing head coach aims to end with glory against France After eight years, 85 Tests, 76 wins and 3,411 points scored, England’s head coach Simon Middleton takes charge of his final match on Saturday. It should be quite a finale, with a world-record crowd for a women’s game in excess of 53,000 expected at Twickenham as the Red Roses go head-to-head with France in a winner-takes-all Six Nations decider. The record currently stands at 42,579, set at the World Cup final at Eden Park in November. The attendance is also sure to smash the current Women’s Six Nations record, set last weekend with 18,604 watching France v Wales at the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. , In the best traditions of Fergie-time, substitute Millie Turner headed home the latest possible winning goal to help Manchester United stretch their lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to six points. The centre-back converted Katie Zelem’s much-disputed free-kick three minutes into added time to keep United’s dreams of a league and FA Cup double alive. , Different reports fly around while Fox News declines to comment on the cancellation of top TV host’s show The exact reason behind the rightwing TV host Tucker Carlson’s abrupt firing from Fox News remains unclear, days after the star’s show was suddenly cancelled. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Carlson was fired after executives discovered vulgar text messages, including one in which he called a top executive the C-word. There were also concerns among Fox management that Carlson was acting as if he was above the network, the Journal reported. , UN’s arbitrary detention group calls for immediate release of Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, saying detention has no basis in law A UN body has declared that the detention of a long-term Guantánamo inmate, Abu Zubaydah, has no lawful basis and called for his immediate release, warning that the systemic deprivation of liberty at the camp may “constitute crimes against humanity”. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD), also declared the UK, among other countries, was “jointly responsible for the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of Mr Zubaydah” over his more than 20 years in detention. , US supreme court justice, who wrote Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, denies claims he was responsible for leak in draft form Samuel Alito said the decision he wrote removing the federal right to abortion made him and other US supreme court justices “targets of assassination” but denied claims he was responsible for its leak in draft form. “Those of us who were thought to be in the majority, thought to have approved my draft opinion, were really targets of assassination,” Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. , Yemeni authorities said ‘suspicious’ and unresponsive ship opened fire, while ship manager reports clash with pirates Armed guards aboard a yacht once owned by the late Welsh actor Richard Burton have fired on approaching ships in the Gulf of Aden, prompting an intense gunfight. Yemeni authorities said the guards mistakenly opened fire on a Coast Guard vessel but the ship’s manager insisted they had clashed with pirates. The shooting reportedly killed one Yemeni Coast Guard member and wounded another person in a hail of gunfire – the guards are said to have shot as many as 200 rounds of ammunition. The incident shows the danger faced by both shippers and security forces in the waters off the Arab world’s poorest country, even as it remains crucial for global commerce. , Crowning of King Charles expected to pass quietly in New Zealand, though there is still some fascination with the crown In town halls and social media groups, New Zealand’s most committed royalists are planning high teas, concerts, and watching parties. For the most dedicated, the memorabilia will be out on display: tea sets and replica tiaras, lifetime collections of Woman’s Weekly front pages and special edition photo books. For others, however – including some of the country’s dedicated royal watchers – the coronation cupcakes and cucumber sandwiches come with a side of doubt, over the future of the monarchy and the changing way that it is viewed in colonised countries. Elizabeth Garlick will watch the coronation live, late into the night, with a group of other royal fans who are planning wine, cheese, and possibly tiaras. She says she fell in love with the royals as a small child, seeing princess Diana in the news, and over time became a “royal watcher” – keeping track of major events in the monarchy’s timeline. “I grew up in a family of other royal watchers – my great aunties, my great nana has [the queen’s] coronation on vinyl,” she says. “For me, this is like a once in a lifetime – a historical moment.” , Evacuations from Sudan, battle raging in Bakhmut, protests against a judicial overhaul in Israel and climate activism in Berlin: the most striking images this week , Government announces end to airlifts amid calls for NHS doctors without UK passports to be rescued British nationals trapped in Sudan have until midday on Saturday local time to get on a flight before they stop, ministers have announced, as a doctors’ union called for NHS medics without UK passports to also be airlifted. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Friday night more than 1,500 people had been flown out, and there had been a “significant decline in British nationals coming forward”, meaning it was time to end the operation. , Four main teaching unions could unite after ‘months of stonewalling’ from education secretary Gillian Keegan All state schools in England could be closed by “unprecedented” coordinated strikes involving all four teaching unions, after their leaders vowed to increase pressure on the government to improve its pay offer. In a joint press conference, the leaders of the four major education unions said they wanted to send a message to the education secretary that she needed to resume negotiations over pay and school funding. , The Conservative party has been too involved in the debasement of public life for too long to be entrusted with its rehabilitation The advertisement for the job of BBC chair for which Richard Sharp successfully applied in November 2020, and from which he resigned on Friday, stipulated that candidates declare any “real or perceived conflict of interest”. Care should be taken over issues that could “be misconstrued, cause embarrassment, or cause public confidence in the appointment to be jeopardised”. One such issue, in Mr Sharp’s case, was helping facilitate guarantees for a personal loan of up to £800,000 from a Canadian financier to Boris Johnson, then prime minister. When asked by the advisory assessment panel that gave the green light for his appointment about perceived conflicts of interest, Mr Sharp said everything had been properly declared. It had not. A report into the process, published on Friday, found that omission to be an unambiguous breach of the rules. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. , Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach has declared that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, has said that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings. But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration. Mr Loach is 86 and Mr Auerbach is 92 on Saturday, and they are still working. For all the challenges of age that both report, they continue to command the heights of their respective vocations – as does another great 92-year‑old artist Bridget Riley, who is about to unveil her first ceiling painting at the British School in Rome. , Conservative party accused of undermining broadcaster by flooding it with cronies after chair’s resignation Rishi Sunak is under pressure to stop appointing Conservatives to key positions at the BBC after Richard Sharp’s resignation prompted criticism the party had undermined the broadcaster by flooding it with cronies. Sharp quit as BBC chair on Friday morning after an investigation concluded he had failed to disclose key information about his relationship with the former prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job in 2021. Sharp helped facilitate an £800,000 loan guarantee for Johnson when he was in the running to take over the broadcaster but did not tell the appointments panel. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter and child cruelty by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , Record heat in southern Europe and chilly start to British growing season spell more misery for shoppers Shoppers have been warned they face more fruit and vegetable shortages, as temperatures in southern Spain soar to unprecedented levels while the UK growing season gets off to a late start because of cold, overcast weather. Temperatures were expected to reach a new April record of 39C (102F) in parts of Andalucía on Friday amid a long-lasting drought that has affected the production of vegetables in Spain. Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday. , Submarine rescue vessel SS-750 was photographed in Baltic four days before still-unexplained explosions, says Danish newspaper A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just prior to the mysterious September blasts, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage confirmed the existence of the hitherto publicly unknown photographs. , South African magnate hopes there will be bidder in auction who prefers 1,993 rare creatures to a superyacht Wanted: an animal-loving billionaire who might consider buying 1,993 threatened white rhinos instead of a new superyacht or a Picasso, or a Picasso onboard a superyacht. John Hume, a South African multimillionaire who started a rhino breeding project with about 200 animals 30 years ago, is selling all the rhinos and the 8,500-hectare (21,000 acres) conservation ranch where they live in what must rank as one of the most unusual ever online auctions. , Council’s preparations are under way but excitement is muted and some say they are unlikely to watch Chris Booth spent much of Tuesday morning supervising the installation of a crown 4.2 metres wide on the stone columns at the front of Nottingham’s Council House. The crown had been brought out of a council depot (where it is stored alongside a vast goose that appears annually for the Nottingham goose fair), repainted and had had its plastic pearls retrofitted with LED bulbs so they can be lit up at night. , Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets. Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in Avengers: Infinity War but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone). , Current science suggests that chrono-activity or adjusting our regimes to suit our body clocks, plus short, sharp workouts, are the key to a beneficial exercise routine Thousands of us have started 2023 with new exercise programmes promising to get us fit, muscle-bound and slim. But the latest science of chrono-exercise (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it. Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym. ,  Max Verstappen will start second on grid for Sunday’s race Hamilton fifth but Russell 11th after disappointing Q2 After a frustrating and stultifying opening to the new Formula One season, Ferrari finally have a moment to savour. How much it meant was clear as Charles Leclerc climbed from his car having taken pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and vigorously pointed to the prancing horse logo on his chest. Pumped by an immaculate performance, he and the Scuderia will view this as the belated opening to 2023 they wanted – but what follows this weekend will more accurately define the scale of their challenge to a dominant Red Bull. Leclerc has taken a battering in the opening three races. He suffered an engine failure in Bahrain, a 10-place grid penalty in Saudi Arabia and was unlucky to be punted out of the race on the first lap in Australia. After a week in which he has had to dismiss rumours of talks with Mercedes to join the team should Lewis Hamilton retire, and in which it was announced that Ferrari’s racing director, Laurent Mekies, is to leave to replace Franz Tost as team principal at AlphaTauri – a blow after the recent loss of technical director David Sanchez to McLaren – Leclerc delivered reason for the embattled team to finally breathe out. ,  Former England captain was strategic adviser to the ECB T20 could have two divisions and 18 teams Andrew Strauss has left his roles as strategic adviser to the England and Wales Cricket Board and chair of the performance cricket committee only three weeks after the changes to the structure of domestic cricket he recommended in last year’s high performance review were declared “dead in the water” by Richard Gould, the governing body’s chief executive. The announcement came on the day it emerged that the men’s Hundred could be abandoned in favour of a new Twenty20 competition, with the ECB said to be concerned the new format has failed to catch on internationally and was not as appealing to the cream of international talent as the widely played alternative. ,  French Open finalist’s struggles continue on clay ATP announces live electronic line calling across Tour One of the greatest challenges of being a top tennis player is remaining one, year after year, even as the rest of the field conspires to tear you down. In the first few months of his sophomore season among the elite, Casper Ruud continues to exemplify that struggle. Ruud, the French Open runner up last year, suffered another early loss on clay, losing 6-3, 6-4 to young Italian Matteo Arnaldi in the second round of the Madrid Open. A year ago, Ruud had reached the fourth round of a grand slam only once. Although he was already a top 10 player, he had a reputation for specialising in clay and thriving in the smaller events. The Norwegian blew every expectation out of the water in his breakthrough season, reaching finals at the French Open, US Open, ATP Finals and Miami Open. A match away from the top spot in New York, he finished the season having reached a career high ranking of No 2. , This debacle brought together a foolish man and a dishonest prime minister, but it also highlights the urgent need for systemic reform A word of advice for anyone who has worked hard to acquire a reputation they cherish: if Boris Johnson approaches, if he comes anywhere near, run a mile. Richard Sharp is the latest proof that, even out of office, Johnson continues to act as reputational napalm, laying waste to careers and turning good names bad. Sharp joins a long list that includes Christopher Geidt, who had the poison task of serving as Johnson’s adviser on ethics; Allegra Stratton, whom the former prime minister said had “sickened” him when she joked about a party in Downing Street, even though he had attended several himself; and the one-time rising star civil servant and current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, quoted this week as having said of Johnson, “I don’t know what more I can do to stand up to a prime minister who lies”. Each entered Johnson’s circle as a respected figure; each was diminished by their contact with the reverse Midas, the man who rots everything he touches. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist , Readers respond to Emma Beddington’s article about the embarrassment she felt at the state of the country when her French in-laws came to visit Emma Beddington writes about being embarrassed by the state of Britain when her French in-laws visited, citing various ways in which the country compares poorly with France (I saw the UK through the eyes of my French in-laws – and it was deeply embarrassing, 23 April). But she ends on a positive note, describing how her in-laws were impressed on a train when they saw “a lovely group of women sitting next to us in Hawaiian garlands, enjoying prosecco at 8am”. If that is the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s not much. I can understand Beddington’s “countrybarrassment”. Especially because there is no other country I have been so much in love with as Britain. For some 60 years, I travelled its length and breath, reading its literature, enjoying its arts. Its people were always welcoming – at least, that is what I thought, and I still think that most of the time the friendliness is sincere. , Readers lament the damage to culture resulting from the government cutting funding Sir Simon Rattle is right to voice his anxiety about the state of classical music in the UK (Simon Rattle is right: Britain is becoming a cultural desert – and that’s a political choice, 26 April). He is concerned for the future of orchestras, opera houses and large choirs as public financial subsidies dry up. I am the secretary of a very small concert-promoting society in north Hertfordshire. We too have lost local authority support, but even more concerning is the diminishing size of our audiences. , Garden charity no longer categorises slugs and snails as pests but sells items that harm them, say critics The Royal Horticultural Society has been criticised for continuing to sell products that kill wildflowers and insects, despite public messaging about protecting biodiversity. Last year, the RHS said slugs and snails would no longer be classed as pests. The leading garden charity said they were an important part of the garden ecosystem and “play an important role in planet-friendly gardening”. , Vaughn Dolphin, from Walsall, West Midlands, had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot A far-right extremist who accidentally set off a “fireball” in his own kitchen while experimenting with explosives has been convicted of terrorism offences. Vaughn Dolphin, who had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot, was found guilty on a series of charges after a jury viewed videos and incriminating conversations on social media. , With dwindling real-terms pay still a sore point, Whitehall staff feel the  Raab bullying case has only unleashed more hostility “Almost every civil servant I talk to is looking for a way out,” says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now an expert on Whitehall. It’s hardly a surprise after the past few years: civil servants have been demonised as workshy by former Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, blamed for the Partygate scandal by Boris Johnson and threatened with 91,000 job cuts. , Decision welcomed by victim after judge decided not to jail Sean Hogg from South Lanarkshire for the offence A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , Upmarket homewares and clothing retailer sees pretax profits rise 18% in post-lockdown recovery The family behind The White Company have given themselves at least £50m in payments as the upmarket homewares and clothing brand bounces back from the pandemic lockdowns. The company paid a £50m dividend to an entity controlled by the founder, Chrissie Rucker, and her husband, Nicholas Wheeler, the founder of the shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt. The group’s highest paid director, thought to be Rucker, took a further £5m in pay, up from £675,000 a year before, as a long-term bonus plan cashed in. , Woman and child die in Dnipro, while missile strikes in Uman, south of Kyiv, kill 19  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 19 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. , Nation’s guidelines say no donor should father more than 25 children in 12 families Dutch judges have ordered a man suspected of fathering more than 550 children through sperm donations to stop donating, in the latest fertility scandal to shock the Netherlands. The man, identified in Dutch media only as Jonathan M, 41, was taken to court by a foundation protecting the rights of donor children and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. , Rapporteurs also chastise the German and Namibian governments for excluding Herero and Nama minorities from talks dealing with the mass murder of their ancestors UN special rapporteurs have criticised the German and Namibian governments for violating the rights of Herero and Nama ethnic minorities by excluding them from talks over reparations for colonial crimes against their ancestors. Publishing their communication with both governments, the seven UN representatives urged Germany to take responsibility for all its colonial crimes in Namibia – including mass murder – and said it was wrong for the Herero and Nama to have been involved indirectly in talks via an advisory committee. They called on Germany to pay reparations directly to the Herero and Nama and not to the Namibian government. , Ricot Jean found dead after reportedly being kidnapped and Dumesky Kersaint reportedly killed by a stray bullet Two more journalists have been killed in Haiti in the past month as rampant gang violence has gripped the capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Ricot Jean, who worked for Radio-Tele Evolution Inter was found dead on Tuesday, a day after he was reportedly kidnapped by men wearing police uniforms. Jean was a prominent cultural activist in the Haitian capital and hosted a weekly radio show. , Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandalsFor the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films. This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other. , The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work • James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599 Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”. In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.” , Authors, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month.

The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added. This ginger, honey and citrus take on the idea involves a blender rather than a bia wun, and uses orange and lime juice instead of the more traditional calamansi juice. It’s a great refreshing drink to welcome the first warm days of spring – and to keep up your sleeve for the hotter months to come. Luke Farrell, Speedboat Bar, London W1 , On her travels Petrina Darrah would often send her mother photographs, then receive a picture of the same place three decades earlier in return  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email When I told my mum I was taking my younger sister to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she could barely contain her excitement. Thirty years before we set foot in Goma, our mother arrived in the same city on a dusty Bedford truck that had carted a swag of lanky youths all the way from London. Back then, the DRC was called Zaire and civil war had yet to tear the region apart. Mum remembers Goma as being quite cosmopolitan. , Fox News settlement seen as ‘moment of weakness’ that puts focus on  mogul’s heirs and their future “Rupert has shown a rare sign of weakness,” says one longtime Murdoch watcher. “There is something of the smell of blood in the water.” In the space of two weeks the 92-year-old’s media empire has taken a reputational hammering on both sides of the Atlantic, putting a renewed focus on the future shape of the global conglomerate’s businesses – and who will run them. , At Omdurman’s open-air market, half of the stalls are shut, customers are scarce and money is tight “I haven’t sold anything since 6am today,” said Adam Musa, a vegetable seller at Omdurman’s open-air market, as fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces raged a few miles away. “There are no people buying.” Musa, 55, faced two problems: a lack of customers, and an inability on the part of those who did come to pay what he was charging. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine. Euromaidan, Kyiv Operativ and Faytuks news have posted videos of the reported attack, which shows a large part of a residential building totally blown apart. It is unknown at this stage how many people were inside. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp. What he did there – and his role in the investigation of three deaths –remains controversial In the middle of a June night 17 years ago in the Guantánamo prison camp, guards and medical orderlies were urgently summoned to one of the inmate clinics, where an emergency was unfolding. Two inmates, Ali Abdullah Ahmed and Mani Shaman al-Utaybi, had been brought in dead. A third, Yasser Talal al-Zahrani, had been rushed to the hospital on the US naval base but was declared dead there soon afterwards. The three men were found hanging from their necks, with their hands and feet bound and rags in their throats. ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Eddie Howe’s gone BIG with this comparison for Newcastle Alexander Isak. There are no two players who are the same but I think he does have some of the characteristics that Thierry Henry had. He has certainly got the speed and is a similar build and frame. Also the footwork. The assist [against Everton] was truly remarkable, really. He has got a lot of potential to improve and get better, but it’s been a great start for him here. Henry joined Brentford in 2016. They were a Championship side and he thought they were a stepping-stone club. He soon realised he was wrong. On Wednesday night Brentford went to Chelsea and won 2-0. They are ninth in the Premier League before hosting Nottingham Forest on Saturday and have a chance of qualifying for Europe. Brentford know how to maximise their resources. They did not panic when Smith went to Villa in 2018. Thomas Frank was an inspired appointment. The Dane led Brentford into the top flight in 2021 and has built a young, hungry side. Brentford flourished after winning promotion and have kept standards high this season. “They say the second season’s the hardest,” Henry says. “But we’ve stayed together. The gaffer said: ‘Don’t take your foot off the pedal.’ , Our selection includes a replayed shootout, a scorer of four consecutive hat-tricks and a moment to forget for Akinfenwa Much was made of the fact that, despite amassing more than 100 points each, only one of Wrexham or Notts County could win automatic promotion to the Football League. In the end the Welsh side prevailed, to the relief of their fans and Hollywood owners, consigning Notts County to the playoffs. In National League South, Ebbsfleet had no need to look over their shoulder as they hit the 100-point mark with one game remaining. The Kent side secured the title with four games to spare and sit 18 points clear of their nearest rivals, Dartford. Ebbsfleet’s march to promotion was masterminded by Dennis Kutrieb, a highly regarded young German who took over at the Stonebridge Road in June 2020, three months after the National League season was halted by the pandemic. Ebbsfleet were relegated by 0.002 of a point when clubs agreed to end the season on a points-per-game basis but have finally booked their return to the fifth tier. , The selection attempts to become only the second horse to follow up a Scottish Grand National victory at Sandown Kitty’s Light would be a hugely popular winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup on Jumps Finale day at Sandown on Saturday, and Christian Williams, his trainer, believes the seven-year-old has the right attitude and constitution to follow up his success in the Scottish Grand National last weekend. “He’s freakish for a horse,” Williams said this week. “The way he comes out of his races, you’ll never have seen anything like it. Basically, you could nearly run him in the next race as he recovers so quickly, so there’s something inside him. I’m not sure if he’s got big lungs or a big heart but there’s something in him that’s different to any other horses that we’ve run.” ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email A Tennesee lawmaker who was previously outsted for calling for gun control after a Nashville mass shooting has spoken about Zephyr being silenced. In an interview with Democracy Now, Tennessee representative Justin Jones spoke with Zephyr about the need for continued solidarity. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , PM tells Scottish Tory conference that Holyrood should instead be ‘held to account’ for not using existing powers enough Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Its producer Aaron Dessner explains how they made it For Ed Sheeran, the release of a new album usually means a confident sweep to No 1 and steady dominance of the Top 40 over the subsequent months. But there is more at stake than usual for the 32-year-old songwriter when he releases his fifth album, – (Subtract), next Friday (5 May). The record documents a series of events last spring that Sheeran has characterised as the most challenging period in his life. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a tumour that couldn’t be operated on until after the birth of their second child. His best friend, music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, died aged 31 after taking cocaine. Sheeran was also subject to a high-profile UK court case in which he faced claims he had copied a pair of songwriters’ work in his 2017 smash hit single Shape of You. , New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff. The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT announced fresh action. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp.

I recommend baking them in heavily buttered muffin tins or silicone moulds; baker Julia Aden recently recommended putting a round piece of greaseproof paper in the base of each mould to help remove small cakes, and it works a treat. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Their justification? That Zephyr’s interaction with protesters who were demonstrating against her earlier silencing by the House’s Republican majority amounted to “encouraging an insurrection.” The Associated Press reports that such claims have become increasingly common in recent months in state legislatures where Republicans rule. Case in point, the rhetoric used by GOP lawmakers to briefly expel two Democrats from the Tennessee state House of Representatives earlier this month. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep.

On three different days last summer, visitors at a beach on the lake discovered skeletal remains along the shoreline. The Clark county coroner’s office announced on Thursday that those remains belonged to the same person, now identified as as Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on 14 July 1998 at the age of 52. , Former England captain talks about his ‘tiring’ condition in Netflix series about his life and career  What are typical symptoms and treatments for OCD?

The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. , As David Beckham appears in Netflix series to talk of living with obsessive compulsive disorder, we take closer look at condition With David Beckham having told of his experiences of living with obsessive compulsive disorder for a new Netflix series, we take a look at the condition, and how common it is. , Bill to go before parliament aims to fight ‘discrimination linked to hair texture, length, colour and style’ France must introduce a law banning hair discrimination against natural afro hairstyles and braids, a lawmaker from Guadeloupe has argued as he prepares a cross-party bill to be presented to parliament in the autumn. “Just as the Republic’s motto is ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’, this is about allowing everyone to be as they are and as they want to be, whether in it’s in the workplace or anywhere else,” Olivier Serva told France Info radio. ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports that a 2018 investigation that played a role in Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the supreme court was less thorough than it appeared. If you read one Guardian story today, make it this one: A 2018 Senate investigation that found there was “no evidence” to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault against the US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh contained serious omissions, according to new information obtained by the Guardian. , Family has been waiting more than 12 months for documents and are now trapped amid violence in Khartoum  Sudan crisis – latest updates The Home Office has been accused of putting the lives of a heavily pregnant woman and her three-year-old daughter at risk as they remain stranded in Sudan while waiting for a UK visa. The family have been waiting more than a year for their documents to be issued, with the mother, who is almost nine months pregnant, trying to shield her daughter from the violence on the streets of Khartoum, the capital. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine.

Eddie Howe’s gone BIG with this comparison for Newcastle Alexander Isak. There are no two players who are the same but I think he does have some of the characteristics that Thierry Henry had. He has certainly got the speed and is a similar build and frame. Also the footwork. The assist [against Everton] was truly remarkable, really. He has got a lot of potential to improve and get better, but it’s been a great start for him here. Henry joined Brentford in 2016. They were a Championship side and he thought they were a stepping-stone club. He soon realised he was wrong. On Wednesday night Brentford went to Chelsea and won 2-0. They are ninth in the Premier League before hosting Nottingham Forest on Saturday and have a chance of qualifying for Europe. Brentford know how to maximise their resources. They did not panic when Smith went to Villa in 2018. Thomas Frank was an inspired appointment. The Dane led Brentford into the top flight in 2021 and has built a young, hungry side. Brentford flourished after winning promotion and have kept standards high this season. “They say the second season’s the hardest,” Henry says. “But we’ve stayed together. The gaffer said: ‘Don’t take your foot off the pedal.’ , Sean Hogg, from South Lanarkshire, was given community sentence after raping 13-year-old  when he was 17 A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , The New York fashion spectacular is paying tribute to the flamboyant genius of the catwalk Karl Lagerfeld, fashion’s greatest showman, reinvented the catwalk as an entertainment channel. His Paris catwalks featured a supermarket selling Coco “Chanel” Pops, a replica Eiffel tower and a spaceship which blasted from the ground in a blaze of smoke. Likewise, the annual Met Gala has transformed the fusty tradition of black-tie museum fundraising dinners to become the most spectacular night of the fashion calendar. Forget little black dresses; think Rihanna as the pope, Kim Kardashian in a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe and Katy Perry wearing a cheeseburger. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

Four days into his jail term, Decker was visited by prison officials and told to remain silent, according to his partner. The warning came as lawyers for Decker consider an appeal against his sentence of two years and seven months for causing a public nuisance with his direct-action protest. , You are not responsible for your mother. You have your own losses – and young children – to deal with I am a woman in my late 30s, married with two small children with a rewarding and demanding career. I live some hours’ drive away from where I grew up and where my mum lives. I really love my life   but I need some advice regarding my relationship with my mum. My lovely dad died last year.  He was much loved and I miss him a great deal, but he gave me so much over his lifetime that I am doing OK without him. My family has probably had more loss than most. One sister died before I was born, and another older sister in her early 30s. My mum has called the loss of my dad the hardest of all. I love her very much but I feel responsible for her and guilty that I live far away.  , On his show Carlson railed against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and apologized for Putinist aggression. None of it is new Fox News has finally broken ties with its most popular star, Tucker Carlson. His ousting has been bemoaned by some commentators, who have taken Carlson to be a rebellious anti-war populist, evading easy political characterization. But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology? In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a pro-Russia monologue urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the real enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States. … It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence. , Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have both been accused of ethics violations – and John Roberts refuses to discuss the matter with Congress It was a short letter. John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, was brief in his missive to Democratic senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence”, Roberts declined to appear before the committee to discuss disturbing recent revelations of ethics violations at the court. Congress is meant to exert checks on judicial power – to investigate or even impeach judges who abuse their office or interpret the law in ways that violate its spirit, and to affirm that the elected branches will hold more sway over policy than the appointed one. But the chief justice’s show of indifference to congressional oversight authority reflects a new reality: that there are now effectively no checks on the power of the court – at least none that Democrats have the political will to use – and that the justices can be assured that they will face no repercussions even if they act in flagrant violation of ethical standards. It seems that they intend to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race. Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation. , Tyler Dupree, James Harrison and Matty Ashton have left part-time rugby league behind and are now in line to face France  Ever heard the one about the electrician, the lifeguard and the builder who went on to represent their country? There could be as many as 15 debutants when a new-look England side takes to the field against France in Warrington on Saturday afternoon, with Shaun Wane sticking to his promise of ripping up the squad that fell short in last year’s Rugby League World Cup and integrating a younger group of players in anticipation for the next tournament in France in 2025. All of those players have their own unique stories to tell, but three in particular can scarcely believe they have reached this point. As recently as 18 months ago, Tyler Dupree and James Harrison were not even full-time Super League players, with Dupree involved in the Oldham side relegated to League 1, the sport’s lowest professional tier, and Harrison playing for Featherstone Rovers. They were released by Leeds and Bradford respectively as teenagers, told they were not good enough and, cast aside from the professional ranks, forced to go part-time. , Suella Braverman flags statutory instrument to public order bill as climate protesters renew campaign Suella Braverman is to give police the power to ban slow walking in traffic by protesters, as Just Stop Oil enters the fifth consecutive day of using the tactic in the latest phase of its climate protest campaign. The home secretary said a statutory instrument to the public order bill, which passed its final stages in parliament on Wednesday, would stop what she described as the “selfish disruptive protesters [who] are wreaking havoc in people’s everyday lives across the country”. , Furious Fox viewers flee to other conservative networks as Brian Kilmeade tries to take the place of network’s ex-most popular host There were a lot of questions floating around after Fox News unceremoniously dumped right-wing firebrand Tucker Carlson on Monday morning. Among them: can the conservative news channel effectively replace its most-popular host, a grievance-filled firebrand who drew in more than three million viewers every night? , Farmers express concern for their livelihoods after series of deadly attacks on farm animals German farmers, conservationists and politicians have met at a wolf summit to discuss the animal’s future amid concerns that its population is out of control. The farmers’ union is calling for a relaxation of rules over when wolves, strictly protected under EU law, can be shot, after a series of highly publicised deadly attacks on farm animals. , ...]</td>\n",

It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” , Committee of MPs says ‘dark cloud of delays’ hindering Britain from reaching renewable energy potential People in the UK are facing waits of up to 15 years for solar installations on their homes due to a lack of grid connectivity, MPs have found. The environmental audit committee, which looks at green policies in government, has said there is a “dark cloud of delays” hindering the country from reaching its potential when it comes to renewable energy. , Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as sterling rallies over $1.26  Trading halted in shares of two more US lenders as fears of banking crisis mount World food prices have risen, for the first time in a year, according to the United Nations food agency this morning.

It builds its world meticulously  – and packs plenty of punch Silo, Apple TV+’s 10-part adaptation of the first book in Hugh Howey’s bestselling trilogy of the same name, is not for the claustrophobic. The world-building is meticulous, and that world is almost entirely underground. The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don’t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It’s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo’s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right. The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive. Silo is on Apple TV+ now. , Bush theatre, LondonThe actor makes his debut as a playwright with a richly detailed character study, performing with warm humour and outrage at injustice ‘Have you seen Theresa May dance? Now that’s a hostile environment.” When the former UK prime minister is introduced halfway through Lenny Henry’s one-man show about the Windrush scandal, she is swiftly dismissed. It’s one more punchline as Henry holds court with a bountiful supply of jokes, accompanied by near constant reggae. Upon taking the stage as August Henderson he is equal parts standup working the club and party host keeping guests lubricated. Drinks are handed out to the audience from a trolley. We join August at home, Jesus and Bob Marley side by side on the wall of Natalie Pryce’s snug set, as he recounts his 52 years in England since arriving from Jamaica on his mother’s passport aged eight. Before May pops up, there are sparing flash-forwards to the devastating impact of her government’s immigration policy on the Windrush generation. August flinches as CCTV footage of his eventual wrongful detention briefly plays on the back wall. But this story is lighter and more linear than Roy Williams’ powerful contribution to the BBC’s Soon Gone series of Windrush monologues, in which Henry’s character Cyrus was introduced in the grip of confusion, his past and present entwined in a tragic spiral. , Labour gains Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent with results still coming in for 230 councils in England, plus four mayoral races  Live results tracker Prof Rob Ford, an elections specialist, has written an article for the Guardian trying to assess what would be a good result and a bad result for the political parties in the local election.

Twenty-two schools and universities across the continent have been occupied as part of a proposed month-long campaign. In Germany, universities were occupied in Wolfenbüttel, Magdeburg, Münster, Bielefeld, Regensburg, Bremen and Berlin. In Spain, students in occupation at the Autonomous University of Barcelona organised teach-outs on climate change. In Belgium, 40 students occupied the University of Ghent. In the Czech republic, about 100 students camped outside the ministry of trade and industry. And in the UK occupations were under way at the universities of Leeds, Exeter and Falmouth. , Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as sterling rallies over $1.26  Trading halted in shares of two more US lenders as fears of banking crisis mount Britain’s financial watchdog has continued its crackdown on illegally operated crypto ATMs. The Financial Conduct Authority has inspected sites in Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield, in its pushback against machines allowing customers to buy or convert traditional currencies into cryptoassets including bitcoin. “Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. The action we’ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity. “Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public. King Dollar, which outperformed in 2022 thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stream of rate hikes, is losing its crown as the central bank approaches the peak of its rate hiking cycle, reducing the allure of the world’s reserve currency. Other currencies including the pound have been benefitting from this shift away from the greenback. Since the nadir last September after the mini-budget which sharply punished sterling, the pound has been on a tear. The US dollar is under pressure against the pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen today as investors expect a weak jobs report stateside later today with 180,000 job creations anticipated in April, the lowest monthly gain since December 2019 before the pandemic. , What’s it like to share a carriage with Charles and Camilla? Still waiting for my invitation to the coronation, I grabbed a ride with a pair of lookalikes – and even made it into Buckingham Palace This Saturday at 10.20am, all eyes will be on King Charles and Camilla as they travel the 1.3 miles from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in their £1.5m Diamond jubilee state coach. That’s roughly a £10 ride in an Uber. At 1pm, they will return to Buckingham Palace in their £3.5m gold state coach, again drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. There they will appear on the balcony for a ceremonial flypast. Or, if you prefer, Channel 4 is showing Frasier, Johnny English Strikes Again and Formula E. What does it feel like knowing half of the world will be settling down with their prosecco and Pringles to gawp at you? There would have to be an administrative error of cataclysmic proportions for me to be accidentally crowned king, or even to share part of the big day with him. But I can find out what it’s like to be part of the royal fuss. Bafta-winning film-maker, artist and photographer Alison Jackson – famous for shooting a fake Diana flicking the Vs, a fake Queen drinking tea in bed and a fake Donald Trump partying with the KKK – has organised a phoney coronation complete with Charles and Camilla lookalikes and horse-drawn carriage. And it turns out that she needs a footman to open carriage doors and light Camilla’s fags. What can possibly go wrong? , Mohamed Nur, of south-west London, charged with murder and possession of offensive weapon, police say A man has been charged with the murder of the stabbing victim Johanita Dogbey as well as offences connected to alleged knife attacks two days earlier. Mohamed Nur, 33, of Bond Way, south-west London, was charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon, the Metropolitan police said. , (Diatribe Records)Free jazz, opera, hymns, punk and newscasts intermingle in an oddly compelling sonic collage addressing issues of asylum and migration Anyone who has heard the Beatles’ Revolution No 9 will be familiar with musique concrète: a compositional style based around the manipulation of existing recordings and found sounds, one pioneered by the likes of Pierre Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Sovereign Bodies/Ritual Taxonomy is very much a sound collage in this vein: a jarring sonic montage assembled by Belfast-based composer Jamie Thompson featuring snatches of free jazz, opera, hip-hop, electronica, spoken word and broadcast news. It sounds like someone maniacally dialling between multiple stations on multiple radios. Crucially, however, these disparate snippets of music have been specifically recorded for this project. And, as the album progresses, you realise that it is not random or formless, but a virtual audio drama themed around asylum and migration, displacement and assimilation, detention centres and perilous boat journeys. The few male voices here represent bureaucratic authority; the rest are female voices of resistance. The spoken-word poet Felicia Olusanya serves as a kind of narrator; the voice of operatic soprano Amy Ní Fhearraigh is put on to dubplates and manipulated by turntablist Mariam Rezaei; saxophonist Catherine Sikora Mingus howls over a doomy gothic chorale. , The Back to the Future star is funny, engaging and incredibly candid about living with Parkinson’s. Plus the classic tale of the girl who moves things with her mind , A heart attack prompts the Guardian journalist to investigate the underlying causes of our uniquely polarised moment On the last day of 2019 Rafael Behr had a heart attack, a really bad one, the kind known as a “widowmaker”. As he was recovering he was told he’d need to avoid stress. Which, as a political columnist for the Guardian, given the state of things, was no easy task. This book is pitched as an attempt to find a path back to engaging with current affairs without ending up in an ambulance again. The good news is that Behr has avoided any further trips to the hospital. The bad news is that he still seems pretty annoyed. Certainly the reader will find their blood pressure rising as the story of politics over the past few years is retold. , In this week’s newsletter: Despite enthusiasm for the monarchy sinking to a reported low, apparently Britain can’t get enough of King Charles tat  Don’t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox?

Based on results counted early on Friday morning, the party said it was heading for a result that if repeated across the country at a general election would give them an eight-point lead over the Conservatives. , Russian foreign minister reiterates Kremlin claim that Moscow drone incident was a ‘terrorist attack’ What we know on day 436 of the invasion The UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update that “a recent uptick in Russian rail accidents in areas bordering Ukraine, attributed to sabotage committed by unknown actors, has almost certainly caused short-term localised disruption to Russian military rail movements”.

Kwarteng’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the mini-budget, helping the pound to recover. Valero, a senior policy fellow at London School of Economics’s Centre for Economic Performance, warned that using tax cuts as a “quick fix” to boost growth wouldn’t work and called for more generous incentives to spur business investment. The remarks underscore the competing demands Hunt faces if he finds money for giveaways ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024. He’s facing pressure from the ruling Conservative Party to reduce the tax burden, which is the highest it’s been in decades. “IAG has delivered its first Q1 profit since 2019, confirming the departure from the tricky Covid period. Trading was strong aided by the twin forces of lower fuel prices and strong demand; however, some credit is also due to IAG’s own actions and focus on core North American and Latin American markets. Going forward, the company recognises that there may be headwinds but improved profitability and the ability to lower debt should put it in a robust position.” , IAG expects to fly almost the same passenger numbers this year as before Covid pandemic The owner of British Airways has upgraded its full-year profit expectations thanks to strong demand for holiday travel, as the airline group said it expected to fly almost the same number of passengers this year as it did before the coronavirus pandemic. International Airlines Group (IAG) reported a first-quarter profit for the first time since 2019, before the travel industry was plunged into chaos by Covid lockdowns. It made an operating profit of €9m (£7.9m) in the first three months of the year. , Labour gains Plymouth and Stoke-on-Trent with results still coming in for 230 councils in England, plus four mayoral races  Live results tracker Prof Rob Ford, an elections specialist, has written an article for the Guardian trying to assess what would be a good result and a bad result for the political parties in the local election.

In early results, the Lib Dems defeated the Conservatives to win control of Windsor and Maidenhead council, Theresa May’s home territory. , Former US president said Putin disavowed Yeltsin deal over Ukraine; Ukrainian air force downed own drone after it lost control over Kyiv  What we know on day 436 of the invasion The UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update that “a recent uptick in Russian rail accidents in areas bordering Ukraine, attributed to sabotage committed by unknown actors, has almost certainly caused short-term localised disruption to Russian military rail movements”.

They were not wrong. But just how tough is the big question to come for Rishi Sunak. Divining UK-wide political lessons from early results in low-turnout elections from an arbitrary selection of areas across only England is, of course, hugely difficult, which is where the work of the party media spinners comes in. , As the results come in, find out how Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems and other parties fared in Thursday’s polls for hundreds of English councils  Latest reporting and analysis About these elections On 4 May, 230 English councils are holding elections with more than 8,000 seats being contested. Some are for metropolitan boroughs such as Liverpool city council and others for unitary authorities such as Herefordshire or North Somerset. Both structures are single-tier authorities with responsibility for the whole range of council services, including education, social care, rubbish collection and parks. , Two-year study by Nuffield Trust and LSE says successive governments failed to make social care a priority Distress and heartbreak for millions could have been avoided if the government had not missed opportunities to prepare social care for a pandemic, according to a big investigation into how the first wave of Covid hit care homes. A review of events in spring 2020, when almost 20,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales, found it was the result of “letting one of our most important public services languish in constant crisis for years”. The government excluded social care from pandemic-planning exercises such as Exercise Alice and after problems were identified by Exercise Cygnus, which did include the sector, action was not taken. Social care leaders felt invisible at the start of the pandemic because there had been no dedicated director general for social care in government since 2016. No adult social care representatives sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and people leading the UK pandemic response lacked “deep understanding” of social care. , GPs say trans people being put at risk by lack of evidence on how to assess them by gender-based metrics A host of algorithms used by medics to assess disease risk and help make decisions on treatment are failing to take transgender patients into account, doctors have said. Many metrics and thresholds in medicine, including ideal body weight, alcohol clearance rates, kidney function and risk of cardiovascular disease vary by gender. , Calls follow release of account by captain who said he strongly warned against ‘folly’ of attempted landing in June 1982 The release of a witness account detailing the “folly” of an operation in which 56 service personnel died on ships off the Falkland islands – the deadliest day for the British military since 1945 – has prompted fresh calls for the government to unseal all files relating to the tragedy. Attacks by Argentinian Skyhawk planes against the landing ships Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad killed dozens of service personnel on 8 June 1982 and left more than 150 injured, including Simon Weston, the Welsh guard whose disfigured face became a defining image of the conflict. , Police searching for attacker who fired automatic weapon from a moving vehicle in town south of Belgrade, injuring a further 13 At least eight people have been killed and 13 injured in Serbia in a series of shootings south of Belgrade, state-run media has reported, just one day after a school shooting also saw nine killed in the capital. The shootings started late on Thursday near the town of Mladenovac when an attacker opened fire with an automatic weapon from a moving vehicle and then fled, state broadcaster RTS television reported. Seven of the injured are in a critical condition. , Rightmove says rise due to higher home loan rates and record asking prices for properties New first-time buyers are typically paying nearly £200 a month more on their mortgage than a year ago because of a combination of higher home loan rates and record asking prices for properties, new data shows. The figures from property website Rightmove underline the challenging conditions facing those hoping to get on to the UK housing ladder, with separate figures this week indicating that house prices have resumed their upwards march at the same time that average rents are hitting fresh highs. , Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news  Trading halted in shares of two more US lenders as fears of banking crisis mount Stocks have opened higher in London, as share claw back some of yesterday’s losses.

The highly infectious variant of H5N1 has caused Europe’s worst bird flu outbreak, resulting in the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades. Conservationists are warning that it could mean the extinction of some seabird species, as breeding colonies have been particularly badly hit. , Elizabeth’s crowning seemed like a new dawn. But the reign of Charles begins in a kingdom under a cloud No one under the age of 75 can have anything but the haziest memory of the last time we did this. Britain has not witnessed a coronation since 1953, and even those who remember the crowning of Elizabeth II will have little to guide them. We are a different country now, and Charles a very different prospective monarch – if only because of one simple, unavoidable fact: he is an old king. Start not with him, but with us. The Britain of 1953 would scarcely recognise itself in the Britain of 2023. Obviously the entire world has transformed. Ask someone who recalls the last coronation and they’ll soon tell you about the novel thrill of seeing the ceremony on live television, perhaps at the home of a neighbour who was the one person on the street lucky enough to own a “set”. Today, almost every one of us has a supercomputer in our pocket, complete with a screen able to carry live colour pictures from anywhere on Earth – or even of a distant planet. , Despite gestures towards inclusivity, the ceremony remains rooted in outdated religious and feudal ideals At the heart of the coronation of Charles III on Saturday is a very deliberate national deception about religion. In some ways, the deception hides in plain sight, not attracting attention. Pre-coronation speculation has focused instead on more trivial things – Camilla, Harry, Meghan – or on monarchy’s general popularity in the post-Elizabeth era. But when you watch and listen to the coronation itself, the religious deception will be hard to miss – and harder to believe. Many will instinctively want to be generous about the coronation and will not want to spoil the party. In that spirit, they might call this weekend’s ritual a historical pretence that pleases many and does no particular harm. If they were being stronger-minded, as they ought to be about an event that inevitably says so much about this country to itself and the world, they could instead call the ritual what it is: a lie at the heart of the British state. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist , From conflict at George IV’s crowning to Charles III’s downsized audience, the ceremony is a constant reinvention King Charles’s coronation will put the thousand-year history of the British monarchy on display, but the royal family’s pomp and circumstance is not as historic as it might appear. In 1953, for example, the royals had to borrow extra horse-drawn carriages from a film company for Elizabeth II’s coronation. Sir David Cannadine, a historian and author of The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, has written about the reinvention of coronation traditions over the centuries. , Australian Jake Smith’s collection, including an 1845 menu for the king of Hanover, shows some dishes favoured by previous British monarchs that are definitely not on King Charles’s menu In a time before coronation quiches, a new monarch might diligently work through dozens of courses. They might slurp through a turtle soup or pheasant consommé or brave a maupygernon – which one UK MP described as a grim recipe “based on hogs’ kidneys and flavoured with ingredients suggesting the witches’ cauldron in Macbeth”. , The Oscar-winning actor is back for the Book Club sequel. But what she really wants to talk about is big cars, her love for Woody Allen – and her unexpected passion Even before her dog almost dies, my call with Diane Keaton is chaotic. There’s a delay on the line. Conversation stops and starts like a milk float. I’d emailed questions but she hasn’t read them. She wants to talk about doors. Every answer comes stacked with caveats. It’s fun and stressful – and smart. She wants to escape her own interview. Now 77, Hollywood’s most self-effacing star doesn’t do video calls. Neither does her character in the Book Club films, the latest of which starts with her struggling to speak via her laptop to best friends played by Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen. , Sections of industry back synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels, but case is much stronger for aviation Most bright red sports cars do not make much of their green credentials. Yet a test run in Bicester, Oxfordshire, by the startup Zero Petroleum last month gave a glimpse of a future in which combustion engines did not add new carbon to the atmosphere. The car was running on e-fuel: petrol made using electricity, hydrogen from water, and carbon captured from the air. The automotive industry is steadily moving away from fossil fuels, and a firm global consensus has emerged that battery electric vehicles are the way forward. Yet that consensus took a knock in March when the EU – to the shock of energy experts, environmental campaigners and much of the car industry – opened a small back door to e-fuels. , People who sought route to Europe before fighting erupted in Khartoum speak of police brutality, torture and homelessness Ever since fighting erupted in his home town of Nyala, the state capital of South Darfur in Sudan, in mid-April, Khaled’s mobile phone has not stopped ringing. Family members, friends and acquaintances want to know how to reach north Africa and which country is best for departing for Europe. The 17-year-old, currently living in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, wishes he could tell them that the journey is simple and that countries like Tunisia and Libya are welcoming and safe. , With more bank holidays on the way, these properties should give you space to entertain friends and family , Long synonymous with cheesy pop and earnest ballads, the song contest is also now home to bombastic metal. Past rockers and 2023 contestants explain why they’re actually a perfect fit Mention Eurovision and most people will instantly think of Abba’s Waterloo, or the sight of Céline Dion singing Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi in her widest-shouldered blazer. The contest is notorious for thrusting the cheesiest, most bombastic pop it can find into 180 million people’s living rooms every May, and most of the artists playing 2023’s edition in Liverpool on 13 May will cleave to one of two formulas: Europop bangers, or earnest ballads delivered with beseeching, outstretched arms. Yet since the turn of the century, Eurovision’s love for singalong anthems and OTT theatre has unintentionally made it perfect for a genre that positions itself as pop’s polar opposite: heavy metal. The genre has employed larger-than-life drama ever since Iron Maiden started taking a 10ft-tall zombie on tour; even the most satanic black metal heretics often take to the stage in facepaint. And so nearly every Eurovision throws up a ferocious metal curveball, the most famous being the orc-cosplaying Lordi who won for Finland in 2006 with Hard Rock Hallelujah. Other memorable performances include those by Icelandic electro-goth BDSM troupe Hatari in 2019, bare-chested Finns Teräsbetoni in 2008, and Eldrine, an Evanescence-esque Georgian band in 2011. , The cries of gulls serenade our tipsters as they promenade past funfairs, stripy beach huts and ice-cream shops from Cornwall to Aberdeen.

There’s a seafront pub right there in Kingsand, the Devonport, just up the steps, serving delicious food – or you can just sit outside and look at the sunset. We went to Kingsand for our very first holiday together, my then-lover and I. I booked at short notice – the guesthouse we stayed in has since been put up for sale. We played guitar on the beach and got roped into a sea shanty singalong with the locals. We went back about 10 years later – same beach, same gorgeous yellow house on the beach, same pub.

This is daily life for Chris and his family, who own a 486-hectare (1,200-acre) farm, and for the other 14 homes in the upper Coquet valley in Northumberland national park. The noisy generator and toxic fumes are in stark contrast to the tranquil and picturesque hills of one of the most beautiful landscapes in the UK. Katherine Singer points to her neighbour’s house in the distance approximately a mile away. The homes of the valley are few and far between, adding to the remoteness of the area. , Blume’s groundbreaking books shepherded me and millions of others through the trials of adolescence – and they’re still as relevant as ever It is a truth universally acknowledged that being a teenage girl sucks. Struggling with a changing body, navigating the schoolyard hierarchies, feeling disconnected from your parents, being sexualised in ways you are both ready and not ready for – like most of my peers, I went through the wringer between the ages of 12 and 18. When I look at my six-year-old daughter now, I worry about what she’ll have to face in the hormone trenches – but I’m comforted that, like me, she’ll have Judy Blume. , All hail the nature arbitrary of privilege that’s hereditary  Sign up here to get an email whenever First Dog cartoons are published Get all your needs met at the First Dog shop if what you need is First Dog merchandise and prints , The British boxer will be a huge underdog on the champion’s home turf but he is promising the crowd a fight to remember John Ryder’s boyhood dream was to be a firefighter and on Saturday night he may need to draw on that hazy past to fight the blazing inferno that could engulf him when he steps into the ring against Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez in Guadalajara. Canelo, the flame-haired Mexican boxing legend, remains the most popular fighter in the world and this defence of his undisputed world super-middleweight title is his first bout in his home country since November 2011. Mexico will be in a fever all week, especially in the teeming city of Guadalajara, 20 miles from where the boxer grew up in Juanacatlán. Ryder, the aspiring fire-fighter, grew up on Upper Street in Islington, which will seem a very long way away in the final hours before he faces the might and fury of Canelo in front of a fiery crowd of 48,000 at the Estadio Akron. , In the aftermath of the sprinter’s death at the age of just 32, her USA teammate remembers a talented athlete who did things her own way The post-race glory photo-op is a time honored tradition, an occasion for athletes to get their hit of global adulation in case their compatriot fans forget to tune in to the medal ceremony. Tori Bowie never looked more resplendent than she was in a snapshot of USA’s 4x100m women’s team after their remarkable triumph at the 2016 Olympics. Interlocked with Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tianna Bartoletta in a postcard for #blackgirlmagic, Bowie served a little bit of everything on that hot and sticky evening at João Havelange Stadium on the penultimate night of the Games. She flexed serious power with those washboard abs and flashed pops of color with her fuchsia headband – a silken cousin to the bonnets many Black women use to preserve their locks. But instead of wearing it to bed, Bowie wore hers on the world’s biggest stage. Gardner says that was typical of Bowie: “never what the world asked for, always unapologetically her”. , Former amateurs have risen from obscurity and hired Owen Coyle but there are questions over funding and sustainability Depending on one’s outlook, Friday evening in the unlikely surroundings of Ochilview Park could either see a Scottish football fairytale come to life or the latest temporary vindication of the boom-or-bust culture that has scarred the game in the past. Queen’s Park, who were amateurs for more than a century and proud of it, will earn a place in the top flight as a professional team if they defeat Dundee. But for an Arsenal-esque stumble – Queen’s have won one of their past six games – promotion would already have been secured. Sixty-five years have passed since Queen’s, formed in 1867 and Scotland’s oldest league club, played top-division football. In those more simple times of 1957-58, Hearts secured the title at a canter from the Old Firm as The Spiders won four matches out of 34. In the intervening decades Queen’s have generally floated around the nether regions of Scotland’s league structure. They were a cuddly club, untouched by the corporate classes. , UN children’s agency welcomes drop in number of underage brides, but warns 12 million girls still getting married each year The number of child marriages is declining worldwide, but at too slow a pace for any hope of eliminating the practice this century, Unicef, the UN children’s agency, has said. In a new report, Unicef tentatively welcomed the reduction but warned that it was nowhere close to meeting its sustainable development goal of ridding the world of the practice by 2030. , Neely, 30, whose subway death was ruled a homicide by New York’s medical examiner, remembered as kind and loving Jordan Neely had a fan club. The 30-year-old Michael Jackson impersonator had amassed a following within New York City and beyond, with thousands online admiring the young man’s aptitude for dance and creating a Facebook group to share his performances. , Arizona high court found no evidence of the failed gubernatorial candidate’s claim of 35,000 fraudulent votes in election Lawyers for Kari Lake, the failed Republican gubernatorial candidate, were sanctioned $2,000 on Thursday by the Arizona supreme court in their unsuccessful challenge of her defeat in the governor’s race last year to Democrat Katie Hobbs. In an order, the state’s highest court said Lake’s attorney made “false factual statements” that more than 35,000 ballots had been improperly added to the total ballot count, imposing 10 days to submit payment. , A post 9/11 murder mystery from the makers of Gossip Girl, and the Fab Five are back to sprinkle their makeover magic on New Orleans. Plus: The Muppets Mayhem , Hilarity ensues when two laid-back community support officers are asked to infiltrate a drug gang. Plus: the Prince of Bel-Air reboot rolls on. Here’s what to watch this evening , (Captured Tracks)With their classic late-60s songwriting and beautiful harmonies, the New York duo have never mined the past more effectively than on this fourth album  Musical pastiche can be dangerous. When you go beyond having influences to embodying those influences, artists can easily slip into self-parody. You need spectacularly good songs to pull it off. The Lemon Twigs, a US duo who have often been dangerously close to mere cosplay – perpetually caught in a time vortex where they get sent back to 1967 every time they reach 1976 – have managed it with historic aplomb on their fourth album. The biggest touchstone is the beautifully harmonised existential dread of the Beach Boys post-Pet Sounds flop era: rarely has stark despair (one song is called Every Day Is the Worst Day of My Life) sounded so lovely. There’s also pre-disco Bee Gees, Byrds psych-pop, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and James Taylor’s sturdy craft, and a touch of classic rock on What You Were Doing (which also recalls Teenage Fanclub, and their own harking back). , The Suede bassist’s alternative-history romp through the theatres and over the rooftops of Elizabethan London is full of charm and vigour The Ghost Theatre begins with a London rooftop chase worthy of Mission: Impossible. Our young heroine, Shay, hurtles above Eastcheap and St Peter’s Hill, St Paul’s Church a landmark in the near distance. “She came down with a crash, sending a flock of pigeons skywards in a soft explosion of feathers. They spread like a fountain and she repeated the catechism under her breath: The gods are birds and the birds are gods. She let its cadence guide her feet. The gods – step – are birds – step – and the birds – step – are gods – leap.” In his debut, 2020’s The Ruins, Mat Osman proved himself to be a vivid and imaginative writer. That was the story of two brothers, a 21st-century tale of murder and mystery that embraced the fantastical as it moved through London, Los Angeles, Las Vegas. It was published just before the first Covid lockdown, when our collective attention was understandably elsewhere. But Osman, bassist and founding member of the British band Suede, knows something about perseverance. His second novel is another wild ride, a vigorous adventure that reinforces the sense of an author with energy and wit to spare. , Who said the floral midi-dress was dead?

Jonathan Freedland examines what the event means to the modern-day UK In a ceremony on Saturday steeped in history, King Charles III will finally receive the crown. At 74 years old, he will be the oldest monarch ever to take the throne. At the same age, his mother was gearing up for her golden jubilee. And as the Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland tells Maeve McClenaghan, this means there will be a very different tone from the last coronation. Rather than a country crowning a young queen who was virtually unknown as a public figure, Charles’s views on everything from architecture to ecology have been widely aired. And his reign will be as an old man. , Looking at the health problems caused by air pollution, poorer communities have most to gain Clean-air or low-emission zones are being rolled out in more UK cities, and the London mayor is proposing to extend the ultra-low emission zone to the suburbs. These zones are designed to speed up the attainment of legal limits for air pollution and to lessen the health burden from breathing poor air. While not new, such zones can be controversial, especially when they are introduced or expanded. , The best of this week’s wildlife photographs, including rescued turtles, a fox cub and Pablo Escobar’s hippos ]   \n",

                                [Uncrewed combat aerial vehicles, or attack drones, have become a common feature of the modern battlefield. Russia has deployed them to terrorise civilians in Ukraine and disable essential infrastructure, and Ukraine has also relied heavily on drones for attack, reconnaissance and surveillance. But these aren't the only 'killer robots' that armies are utilising. Josh Toussaint-Strauss explores how the weaponisation of general-purpose robots and the developments of a wider array of advanced mobile robotics and AI powered machine are changing the dynamics of modern warfare in ways that have prompted leading robotics companies and the UN to raise the alarm and call for greater restrictions  Part of the kill chain’: how can we control weaponised robots?  ]   \n",

The picture was posted on Instagram by staff member Pol Perello and captioned: “Pleasures that this job brings you!!” ,  Qatari banker offers around £5bn for 100% of club Interested parties needed to make offers by 10pm BST on Friday Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have lodged final bids for Manchester United by Friday’s 10pm BST deadline. The offers are markedly less than the £6bn valuation of the club’s owners, the Glazers. Sheikh Jassim, a Qatari banker, remains intent on purchasing 100% of the club but will not pay more than what he believes United are worth. The Guardian understands this is around £5bn, roughly £1bn below the American family’s asking price. ,  Si leads 14-10 after one of the best sessions ever seen Mark Selby leads Mark Allen 7-6 in gruelling semi-final Luca Brecel staged a brave fightback to stay in his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Si Jiahui in one of the most exciting sessions witnessed at the Crucible. The Chinese world No 80, who has wowed fans over the last two weeks with his brilliant attacking game, looked on course to win the match with a session to spare when he won the first three frames of the evening session, extending his lead from 11-5 to 14-5 with breaks of 90, 132 and 97. ,  Bochum 1-1 Borussia Dortmund Bayern Munich will go top if they beat Hertha Berlin on Sunday The Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund’s title chances suffered a serious blow on Friday after they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at struggling Bochum. Dortmund are on 61 points with four matches remaining, two points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich, who will move top if they beat bottom club Hertha Berlin on Sunday. , Colombian author’s En Agosto Now Vemos (We’ll See Each Other in August) had been just a rumour but now fans will get to read it Rumours had long circulated that an entire literary masterpiece, never seen by the public, could still be lying in a dusty safe held by the late author’s family or under lock and key at his archive at the University of Texas. On Friday Penguin Random House confirmed that an unpublished Gabriel García Márquez novel – titled En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We’ll See Each Other in August) – not only exists, but will be on shelves across Latin America in 2024. , Tree design includes names of Commonwealth nations, and poles are made from tree from Windsor estate The king and the queen consort will be anointed behind a specially created screen of fine embroidery, held by poles hewn from an ancient windblown Windsor oak and mounted with eagles cast in bronze and gilded in gold leaf, Buckingham Palace has announced. The anointing screen has been blessed at a special service at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, and will be used at what historically has been viewed as the most sacred moment of the coronation. , Wikimedia UK says it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill Wikipedia could be made inaccessible to UK readers due to issues over complying with the online safety bill, a charity affiliated with the website has warned. Lucy Crompton-Reid, the chief executive of Wikimedia UK, warned the popular site could be blocked because it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the bill. , Scotland’s Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has been asked to look into the killing of Glasgow teacher  Scotland’s police watchdog has been ordered to launch an investigation into the murder of a pregnant teacher in Glasgow after finding the body of her fiance in a reservoir days later. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said it had been instructed to carry out the probe after the death of Marelle Sturrock, who was found at her home on Tuesday. , The former striker discusses visiting hospitals in his homeland, his push to raise funds and Champions League hopes for Milan “It was an incredible, emotional moment for me to spend time with her,” Andriy Shevchenko says as he describes meeting a little Ukrainian girl called Maryna last month. The most famous former footballer from Ukraine, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2004 and the Champions League with Milan before he also coached his country at Euro 2020, pauses as he reflects on a simple encounter where he kicked a football back and forth in hospital with the six-year-old. The images of their kickaround assume a grainy resonance when it is explained that Maryna had become the first child in Ukraine to receive a prosthetic limb after her leg was blown off by a Russian missile last year. For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball. , Forty-year-old festival sees chefs use power tools to mix the eggs before a fork lift hoists the enormous frying pan into place Using 8,400 eggs, 25kg of venison sausage and 14 bottles of salt and pepper, New Caledonia’s giant omelette festival aims to bring people together in a region that is often divided. “It is important to have festivals like this. The giant omelette is a symbol of sharing,” says veteran chef Reine Chenot. , Twickenham is expected to host over 53,000 fans as England’s departing head coach aims to end with glory against France After eight years, 85 Tests, 76 wins and 3,411 points scored, England’s head coach Simon Middleton takes charge of his final match on Saturday. It should be quite a finale, with a world-record crowd for a women’s game in excess of 53,000 expected at Twickenham as the Red Roses go head-to-head with France in a winner-takes-all Six Nations decider. The record currently stands at 42,579, set at the World Cup final at Eden Park in November. The attendance is also sure to smash the current Women’s Six Nations record, set last weekend with 18,604 watching France v Wales at the Stade des Alpes in Grenoble. , In the best traditions of Fergie-time, substitute Millie Turner headed home the latest possible winning goal to help Manchester United stretch their lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to six points. The centre-back converted Katie Zelem’s much-disputed free-kick three minutes into added time to keep United’s dreams of a league and FA Cup double alive. , Different reports fly around while Fox News declines to comment on the cancellation of top TV host’s show The exact reason behind the rightwing TV host Tucker Carlson’s abrupt firing from Fox News remains unclear, days after the star’s show was suddenly cancelled. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Carlson was fired after executives discovered vulgar text messages, including one in which he called a top executive the C-word. There were also concerns among Fox management that Carlson was acting as if he was above the network, the Journal reported. , UN’s arbitrary detention group calls for immediate release of Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, saying detention has no basis in law A UN body has declared that the detention of a long-term Guantánamo inmate, Abu Zubaydah, has no lawful basis and called for his immediate release, warning that the systemic deprivation of liberty at the camp may “constitute crimes against humanity”. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD), also declared the UK, among other countries, was “jointly responsible for the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of Mr Zubaydah” over his more than 20 years in detention. , US supreme court justice, who wrote Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, denies claims he was responsible for leak in draft form Samuel Alito said the decision he wrote removing the federal right to abortion made him and other US supreme court justices “targets of assassination” but denied claims he was responsible for its leak in draft form. “Those of us who were thought to be in the majority, thought to have approved my draft opinion, were really targets of assassination,” Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Friday. , Yemeni authorities said ‘suspicious’ and unresponsive ship opened fire, while ship manager reports clash with pirates Armed guards aboard a yacht once owned by the late Welsh actor Richard Burton have fired on approaching ships in the Gulf of Aden, prompting an intense gunfight. Yemeni authorities said the guards mistakenly opened fire on a Coast Guard vessel but the ship’s manager insisted they had clashed with pirates. The shooting reportedly killed one Yemeni Coast Guard member and wounded another person in a hail of gunfire – the guards are said to have shot as many as 200 rounds of ammunition. The incident shows the danger faced by both shippers and security forces in the waters off the Arab world’s poorest country, even as it remains crucial for global commerce. , Crowning of King Charles expected to pass quietly in New Zealand, though there is still some fascination with the crown In town halls and social media groups, New Zealand’s most committed royalists are planning high teas, concerts, and watching parties. For the most dedicated, the memorabilia will be out on display: tea sets and replica tiaras, lifetime collections of Woman’s Weekly front pages and special edition photo books. For others, however – including some of the country’s dedicated royal watchers – the coronation cupcakes and cucumber sandwiches come with a side of doubt, over the future of the monarchy and the changing way that it is viewed in colonised countries. Elizabeth Garlick will watch the coronation live, late into the night, with a group of other royal fans who are planning wine, cheese, and possibly tiaras. She says she fell in love with the royals as a small child, seeing princess Diana in the news, and over time became a “royal watcher” – keeping track of major events in the monarchy’s timeline. “I grew up in a family of other royal watchers – my great aunties, my great nana has [the queen’s] coronation on vinyl,” she says. “For me, this is like a once in a lifetime – a historical moment.” , Evacuations from Sudan, battle raging in Bakhmut, protests against a judicial overhaul in Israel and climate activism in Berlin: the most striking images this week , Government announces end to airlifts amid calls for NHS doctors without UK passports to be rescued British nationals trapped in Sudan have until midday on Saturday local time to get on a flight before they stop, ministers have announced, as a doctors’ union called for NHS medics without UK passports to also be airlifted. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Friday night more than 1,500 people had been flown out, and there had been a “significant decline in British nationals coming forward”, meaning it was time to end the operation. , Four main teaching unions could unite after ‘months of stonewalling’ from education secretary Gillian Keegan All state schools in England could be closed by “unprecedented” coordinated strikes involving all four teaching unions, after their leaders vowed to increase pressure on the government to improve its pay offer. In a joint press conference, the leaders of the four major education unions said they wanted to send a message to the education secretary that she needed to resume negotiations over pay and school funding. , The Conservative party has been too involved in the debasement of public life for too long to be entrusted with its rehabilitation The advertisement for the job of BBC chair for which Richard Sharp successfully applied in November 2020, and from which he resigned on Friday, stipulated that candidates declare any “real or perceived conflict of interest”. Care should be taken over issues that could “be misconstrued, cause embarrassment, or cause public confidence in the appointment to be jeopardised”. One such issue, in Mr Sharp’s case, was helping facilitate guarantees for a personal loan of up to £800,000 from a Canadian financier to Boris Johnson, then prime minister. When asked by the advisory assessment panel that gave the green light for his appointment about perceived conflicts of interest, Mr Sharp said everything had been properly declared. It had not. A report into the process, published on Friday, found that omission to be an unambiguous breach of the rules. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to be considered for publication in our letters section, please click here. , Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach has declared that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, has said that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings. But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration. Mr Loach is 86 and Mr Auerbach is 92 on Saturday, and they are still working. For all the challenges of age that both report, they continue to command the heights of their respective vocations – as does another great 92-year‑old artist Bridget Riley, who is about to unveil her first ceiling painting at the British School in Rome. , Conservative party accused of undermining broadcaster by flooding it with cronies after chair’s resignation Rishi Sunak is under pressure to stop appointing Conservatives to key positions at the BBC after Richard Sharp’s resignation prompted criticism the party had undermined the broadcaster by flooding it with cronies. Sharp quit as BBC chair on Friday morning after an investigation concluded he had failed to disclose key information about his relationship with the former prime minister Boris Johnson when applying for the job in 2021. Sharp helped facilitate an £800,000 loan guarantee for Johnson when he was in the running to take over the broadcaster but did not tell the appointments panel. , Olabisi Abubakar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and mind was ‘thrown off balance’ during Covid lockdown A mother who starved her three-year-old son to death by causing him to join her in a religious fast when she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been found not guilty of manslaughter and child cruelty by reason of insanity. Olabisi Abubakar’s mind was “thrown off balance” by the Covid lockdown and concerns about her immigration status and she began denying herself and her child, Taiwo, food, hoping fasting and prayers would save the world from coronavirus. , Record heat in southern Europe and chilly start to British growing season spell more misery for shoppers Shoppers have been warned they face more fruit and vegetable shortages, as temperatures in southern Spain soar to unprecedented levels while the UK growing season gets off to a late start because of cold, overcast weather. Temperatures were expected to reach a new April record of 39C (102F) in parts of Andalucía on Friday amid a long-lasting drought that has affected the production of vegetables in Spain. Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday. , Submarine rescue vessel SS-750 was photographed in Baltic four days before still-unexplained explosions, says Danish newspaper A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just prior to the mysterious September blasts, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage confirmed the existence of the hitherto publicly unknown photographs. , South African magnate hopes there will be bidder in auction who prefers 1,993 rare creatures to a superyacht Wanted: an animal-loving billionaire who might consider buying 1,993 threatened white rhinos instead of a new superyacht or a Picasso, or a Picasso onboard a superyacht. John Hume, a South African multimillionaire who started a rhino breeding project with about 200 animals 30 years ago, is selling all the rhinos and the 8,500-hectare (21,000 acres) conservation ranch where they live in what must rank as one of the most unusual ever online auctions. , Council’s preparations are under way but excitement is muted and some say they are unlikely to watch Chris Booth spent much of Tuesday morning supervising the installation of a crown 4.2 metres wide on the stone columns at the front of Nottingham’s Council House. The crown had been brought out of a council depot (where it is stored alongside a vast goose that appears annually for the Nottingham goose fair), repainted and had had its plastic pearls retrofitted with LED bulbs so they can be lit up at night. , Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets. Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in Avengers: Infinity War but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone). , Current science suggests that chrono-activity or adjusting our regimes to suit our body clocks, plus short, sharp workouts, are the key to a beneficial exercise routine Thousands of us have started 2023 with new exercise programmes promising to get us fit, muscle-bound and slim. But the latest science of chrono-exercise (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it. Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym. ,  Max Verstappen will start second on grid for Sunday’s race Hamilton fifth but Russell 11th after disappointing Q2 After a frustrating and stultifying opening to the new Formula One season, Ferrari finally have a moment to savour. How much it meant was clear as Charles Leclerc climbed from his car having taken pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and vigorously pointed to the prancing horse logo on his chest. Pumped by an immaculate performance, he and the Scuderia will view this as the belated opening to 2023 they wanted – but what follows this weekend will more accurately define the scale of their challenge to a dominant Red Bull. Leclerc has taken a battering in the opening three races. He suffered an engine failure in Bahrain, a 10-place grid penalty in Saudi Arabia and was unlucky to be punted out of the race on the first lap in Australia. After a week in which he has had to dismiss rumours of talks with Mercedes to join the team should Lewis Hamilton retire, and in which it was announced that Ferrari’s racing director, Laurent Mekies, is to leave to replace Franz Tost as team principal at AlphaTauri – a blow after the recent loss of technical director David Sanchez to McLaren – Leclerc delivered reason for the embattled team to finally breathe out. ,  Former England captain was strategic adviser to the ECB T20 could have two divisions and 18 teams Andrew Strauss has left his roles as strategic adviser to the England and Wales Cricket Board and chair of the performance cricket committee only three weeks after the changes to the structure of domestic cricket he recommended in last year’s high performance review were declared “dead in the water” by Richard Gould, the governing body’s chief executive. The announcement came on the day it emerged that the men’s Hundred could be abandoned in favour of a new Twenty20 competition, with the ECB said to be concerned the new format has failed to catch on internationally and was not as appealing to the cream of international talent as the widely played alternative. ,  French Open finalist’s struggles continue on clay ATP announces live electronic line calling across Tour One of the greatest challenges of being a top tennis player is remaining one, year after year, even as the rest of the field conspires to tear you down. In the first few months of his sophomore season among the elite, Casper Ruud continues to exemplify that struggle. Ruud, the French Open runner up last year, suffered another early loss on clay, losing 6-3, 6-4 to young Italian Matteo Arnaldi in the second round of the Madrid Open. A year ago, Ruud had reached the fourth round of a grand slam only once. Although he was already a top 10 player, he had a reputation for specialising in clay and thriving in the smaller events. The Norwegian blew every expectation out of the water in his breakthrough season, reaching finals at the French Open, US Open, ATP Finals and Miami Open. A match away from the top spot in New York, he finished the season having reached a career high ranking of No 2. , This debacle brought together a foolish man and a dishonest prime minister, but it also highlights the urgent need for systemic reform A word of advice for anyone who has worked hard to acquire a reputation they cherish: if Boris Johnson approaches, if he comes anywhere near, run a mile. Richard Sharp is the latest proof that, even out of office, Johnson continues to act as reputational napalm, laying waste to careers and turning good names bad. Sharp joins a long list that includes Christopher Geidt, who had the poison task of serving as Johnson’s adviser on ethics; Allegra Stratton, whom the former prime minister said had “sickened” him when she joked about a party in Downing Street, even though he had attended several himself; and the one-time rising star civil servant and current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, quoted this week as having said of Johnson, “I don’t know what more I can do to stand up to a prime minister who lies”. Each entered Johnson’s circle as a respected figure; each was diminished by their contact with the reverse Midas, the man who rots everything he touches. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist , Readers respond to Emma Beddington’s article about the embarrassment she felt at the state of the country when her French in-laws came to visit Emma Beddington writes about being embarrassed by the state of Britain when her French in-laws visited, citing various ways in which the country compares poorly with France (I saw the UK through the eyes of my French in-laws – and it was deeply embarrassing, 23 April). But she ends on a positive note, describing how her in-laws were impressed on a train when they saw “a lovely group of women sitting next to us in Hawaiian garlands, enjoying prosecco at 8am”. If that is the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s not much. I can understand Beddington’s “countrybarrassment”. Especially because there is no other country I have been so much in love with as Britain. For some 60 years, I travelled its length and breath, reading its literature, enjoying its arts. Its people were always welcoming – at least, that is what I thought, and I still think that most of the time the friendliness is sincere. , Readers lament the damage to culture resulting from the government cutting funding Sir Simon Rattle is right to voice his anxiety about the state of classical music in the UK (Simon Rattle is right: Britain is becoming a cultural desert – and that’s a political choice, 26 April). He is concerned for the future of orchestras, opera houses and large choirs as public financial subsidies dry up. I am the secretary of a very small concert-promoting society in north Hertfordshire. We too have lost local authority support, but even more concerning is the diminishing size of our audiences. , Garden charity no longer categorises slugs and snails as pests but sells items that harm them, say critics The Royal Horticultural Society has been criticised for continuing to sell products that kill wildflowers and insects, despite public messaging about protecting biodiversity. Last year, the RHS said slugs and snails would no longer be classed as pests. The leading garden charity said they were an important part of the garden ecosystem and “play an important role in planet-friendly gardening”. , Vaughn Dolphin, from Walsall, West Midlands, had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot A far-right extremist who accidentally set off a “fireball” in his own kitchen while experimenting with explosives has been convicted of terrorism offences. Vaughn Dolphin, who had spoken of his desire for ethnic minorities to be shot, was found guilty on a series of charges after a jury viewed videos and incriminating conversations on social media. , With dwindling real-terms pay still a sore point, Whitehall staff feel the  Raab bullying case has only unleashed more hostility “Almost every civil servant I talk to is looking for a way out,” says Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now an expert on Whitehall. It’s hardly a surprise after the past few years: civil servants have been demonised as workshy by former Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, blamed for the Partygate scandal by Boris Johnson and threatened with 91,000 job cuts. , Decision welcomed by victim after judge decided not to jail Sean Hogg from South Lanarkshire for the offence A man who was given a 270-hour community payback sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl in a park is to have his sentence appealed on the grounds it was “unduly lenient”, Scotland’s lord advocate has decided. There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , Upmarket homewares and clothing retailer sees pretax profits rise 18% in post-lockdown recovery The family behind The White Company have given themselves at least £50m in payments as the upmarket homewares and clothing brand bounces back from the pandemic lockdowns. The company paid a £50m dividend to an entity controlled by the founder, Chrissie Rucker, and her husband, Nicholas Wheeler, the founder of the shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt. The group’s highest paid director, thought to be Rucker, took a further £5m in pay, up from £675,000 a year before, as a long-term bonus plan cashed in. , Woman and child die in Dnipro, while missile strikes in Uman, south of Kyiv, kill 19  See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 19 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. , Nation’s guidelines say no donor should father more than 25 children in 12 families Dutch judges have ordered a man suspected of fathering more than 550 children through sperm donations to stop donating, in the latest fertility scandal to shock the Netherlands. The man, identified in Dutch media only as Jonathan M, 41, was taken to court by a foundation protecting the rights of donor children and by the mother of one of the children allegedly fathered from his sperm. , Rapporteurs also chastise the German and Namibian governments for excluding Herero and Nama minorities from talks dealing with the mass murder of their ancestors UN special rapporteurs have criticised the German and Namibian governments for violating the rights of Herero and Nama ethnic minorities by excluding them from talks over reparations for colonial crimes against their ancestors. Publishing their communication with both governments, the seven UN representatives urged Germany to take responsibility for all its colonial crimes in Namibia – including mass murder – and said it was wrong for the Herero and Nama to have been involved indirectly in talks via an advisory committee. They called on Germany to pay reparations directly to the Herero and Nama and not to the Namibian government. , Ricot Jean found dead after reportedly being kidnapped and Dumesky Kersaint reportedly killed by a stray bullet Two more journalists have been killed in Haiti in the past month as rampant gang violence has gripped the capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Ricot Jean, who worked for Radio-Tele Evolution Inter was found dead on Tuesday, a day after he was reportedly kidnapped by men wearing police uniforms. Jean was a prominent cultural activist in the Haitian capital and hosted a weekly radio show. , Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandalsFor the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films. This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other. , The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work • James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599 Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”. In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.” , Authors, critics and Guardian readers discuss the titles they have read over the last month. Join the conversation in the comments In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they have been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a memoir that wrestles with singleness, poetry that feels alive and excellent audiobooks.

The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added. This ginger, honey and citrus take on the idea involves a blender rather than a bia wun, and uses orange and lime juice instead of the more traditional calamansi juice. It’s a great refreshing drink to welcome the first warm days of spring – and to keep up your sleeve for the hotter months to come. Luke Farrell, Speedboat Bar, London W1 , On her travels Petrina Darrah would often send her mother photographs, then receive a picture of the same place three decades earlier in return  Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email When I told my mum I was taking my younger sister to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she could barely contain her excitement. Thirty years before we set foot in Goma, our mother arrived in the same city on a dusty Bedford truck that had carted a swag of lanky youths all the way from London. Back then, the DRC was called Zaire and civil war had yet to tear the region apart. Mum remembers Goma as being quite cosmopolitan. , Fox News settlement seen as ‘moment of weakness’ that puts focus on  mogul’s heirs and their future “Rupert has shown a rare sign of weakness,” says one longtime Murdoch watcher. “There is something of the smell of blood in the water.” In the space of two weeks the 92-year-old’s media empire has taken a reputational hammering on both sides of the Atlantic, putting a renewed focus on the future shape of the global conglomerate’s businesses – and who will run them. , At Omdurman’s open-air market, half of the stalls are shut, customers are scarce and money is tight “I haven’t sold anything since 6am today,” said Adam Musa, a vegetable seller at Omdurman’s open-air market, as fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces raged a few miles away. “There are no people buying.” Musa, 55, faced two problems: a lack of customers, and an inability on the part of those who did come to pay what he was charging. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine. Euromaidan, Kyiv Operativ and Faytuks news have posted videos of the reported attack, which shows a large part of a residential building totally blown apart. It is unknown at this stage how many people were inside. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp. What he did there – and his role in the investigation of three deaths –remains controversial In the middle of a June night 17 years ago in the Guantánamo prison camp, guards and medical orderlies were urgently summoned to one of the inmate clinics, where an emergency was unfolding. Two inmates, Ali Abdullah Ahmed and Mani Shaman al-Utaybi, had been brought in dead. A third, Yasser Talal al-Zahrani, had been rushed to the hospital on the US naval base but was declared dead there soon afterwards. The three men were found hanging from their necks, with their hands and feet bound and rags in their throats. ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments? You can email John or tweet him Quotes coming in to preview Sunday’s games, though a lot of these will come from last night, and have been embargoed. Eddie Howe’s gone BIG with this comparison for Newcastle Alexander Isak. There are no two players who are the same but I think he does have some of the characteristics that Thierry Henry had. He has certainly got the speed and is a similar build and frame. Also the footwork. The assist [against Everton] was truly remarkable, really. He has got a lot of potential to improve and get better, but it’s been a great start for him here. Henry joined Brentford in 2016. They were a Championship side and he thought they were a stepping-stone club. He soon realised he was wrong. On Wednesday night Brentford went to Chelsea and won 2-0.

The gaffer said: ‘Don’t take your foot off the pedal.’ , Our selection includes a replayed shootout, a scorer of four consecutive hat-tricks and a moment to forget for Akinfenwa Much was made of the fact that, despite amassing more than 100 points each, only one of Wrexham or Notts County could win automatic promotion to the Football League. In the end the Welsh side prevailed, to the relief of their fans and Hollywood owners, consigning Notts County to the playoffs. In National League South, Ebbsfleet had no need to look over their shoulder as they hit the 100-point mark with one game remaining. The Kent side secured the title with four games to spare and sit 18 points clear of their nearest rivals, Dartford. Ebbsfleet’s march to promotion was masterminded by Dennis Kutrieb, a highly regarded young German who took over at the Stonebridge Road in June 2020, three months after the National League season was halted by the pandemic. Ebbsfleet were relegated by 0.002 of a point when clubs agreed to end the season on a points-per-game basis but have finally booked their return to the fifth tier. , The selection attempts to become only the second horse to follow up a Scottish Grand National victory at Sandown Kitty’s Light would be a hugely popular winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup on Jumps Finale day at Sandown on Saturday, and Christian Williams, his trainer, believes the seven-year-old has the right attitude and constitution to follow up his success in the Scottish Grand National last weekend. “He’s freakish for a horse,” Williams said this week. “The way he comes out of his races, you’ll never have seen anything like it. Basically, you could nearly run him in the next race as he recovers so quickly, so there’s something inside him. I’m not sure if he’s got big lungs or a big heart but there’s something in him that’s different to any other horses that we’ve run.” ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email A Tennesee lawmaker who was previously outsted for calling for gun control after a Nashville mass shooting has spoken about Zephyr being silenced. In an interview with Democracy Now, Tennessee representative Justin Jones spoke with Zephyr about the need for continued solidarity. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing. While seven people were arrested for trespassing, the boisterous demonstration was free of violence or damage. Yet later that day, a group of Republican lawmakers described it in darker tones, saying Zephyr’s actions were responsible for “encouraging an insurrection.” , PM tells Scottish Tory conference that Holyrood should instead be ‘held to account’ for not using existing powers enough Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. , More than 20 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine.

Portraits of “Mama”, “Nika” (her nickname), her uncles, grandparents and even the family cat “Kuzia” – the names written in by an adult – stretch all along the front of the house. , What prompted Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s phone call; Ukraine’s Orthodox church faces scrutiny Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. , As he defends himself in a New York court, Sheeran is preparing to release Subtract, a stark album informed by grief. Its producer Aaron Dessner explains how they made it For Ed Sheeran, the release of a new album usually means a confident sweep to No 1 and steady dominance of the Top 40 over the subsequent months. But there is more at stake than usual for the 32-year-old songwriter when he releases his fifth album, – (Subtract), next Friday (5 May). The record documents a series of events last spring that Sheeran has characterised as the most challenging period in his life. His wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a tumour that couldn’t be operated on until after the birth of their second child. His best friend, music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, died aged 31 after taking cocaine. Sheeran was also subject to a high-profile UK court case in which he faced claims he had copied a pair of songwriters’ work in his 2017 smash hit single Shape of You. , New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff. The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT announced fresh action. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached. , As a young navy lawyer, the Republican was posted to the notorious prison camp. Questions about what he did there – and his role in the investigation of three deaths – are not going away In the middle of a June night 17 years ago in the Guantánamo prison camp, guards and medical orderlies were urgently summoned to one of the inmate clinics, where an emergency was unfolding. Two inmates, Ali Abdullah Ahmed and Mani Shaman al-Utaybi, had been brought in dead. A third, Yasser Talal al-Zahrani, had been rushed to the hospital on the US naval base but was declared dead there soon afterwards. The three men were found hanging from their necks, with their hands and feet bound and rags in their throats. ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

I recommend baking them in heavily buttered muffin tins or silicone moulds; baker Julia Aden recently recommended putting a round piece of greaseproof paper in the base of each mould to help remove small cakes, and it works a treat. , At least 17 people confirmed dead in wake of Russian aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities on Friday morning  What we know on day 429 of the invasion The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters.

The statue was created by students at the Luigi Rosso art school in Monopoli before being positioned in a square named after the scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini. ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email Earlier this week, Republicans in Montana barred the state’s sole transgender lawmaker, Democrat Zooey Zephyr, from the floor of the state House of Representatives. Their justification? That Zephyr’s interaction with protesters who were demonstrating against her earlier silencing by the House’s Republican majority amounted to “encouraging an insurrection.” The Associated Press reports that such claims have become increasingly common in recent months in state legislatures where Republicans rule. Case in point, the rhetoric used by GOP lawmakers to briefly expel two Democrats from the Tennessee state House of Representatives earlier this month. Silenced by her Republican colleagues, Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr looked up from the House floor to supporters in the gallery shouting “Let her speak!” and thrust her microphone into the air — amplifying the sentiment the Democratic transgender lawmaker was forbidden from expressing.

On three different days last summer, visitors at a beach on the lake discovered skeletal remains along the shoreline. The Clark county coroner’s office announced on Thursday that those remains belonged to the same person, now identified as as Claude Russell Pensinger, who disappeared on 14 July 1998 at the age of 52. , Former England captain talks about his ‘tiring’ condition in Netflix series about his life and career  What are typical symptoms and treatments for OCD? David Beckham has revealed how living with his “tiring” obsessive compulsive disorder leads him to spending hours cleaning and organising his home while the rest of his family are in bed. The former England football captain, 47, says in a forthcoming Netflix documentary: “The fact that when everyone’s in bed I then go around, clean the candles, turn the lights on to the right setting, make sure everywhere is tidy.

The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. , As David Beckham appears in Netflix series to talk of living with obsessive compulsive disorder, we take closer look at condition With David Beckham having told of his experiences of living with obsessive compulsive disorder for a new Netflix series, we take a look at the condition, and how common it is. , Bill to go before parliament aims to fight ‘discrimination linked to hair texture, length, colour and style’ France must introduce a law banning hair discrimination against natural afro hairstyles and braids, a lawmaker from Guadeloupe has argued as he prepares a cross-party bill to be presented to parliament in the autumn. “Just as the Republic’s motto is ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’, this is about allowing everyone to be as they are and as they want to be, whether in it’s in the workplace or anywhere else,” Olivier Serva told France Info radio. ,  January 6 grand jury considering charges against Trump Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports that a 2018 investigation that played a role in Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the supreme court was less thorough than it appeared.

There was widespread outrage expressed by campaigners and politicians when Sean Hogg was not given a jail sentence when he appeared at the high court in Glasgow earlier this month. , The New York fashion spectacular is paying tribute to the flamboyant genius of the catwalk Karl Lagerfeld, fashion’s greatest showman, reinvented the catwalk as an entertainment channel. His Paris catwalks featured a supermarket selling Coco “Chanel” Pops, a replica Eiffel tower and a spaceship which blasted from the ground in a blaze of smoke. Likewise, the annual Met Gala has transformed the fusty tradition of black-tie museum fundraising dinners to become the most spectacular night of the fashion calendar.

Four days into his jail term, Decker was visited by prison officials and told to remain silent, according to his partner. The warning came as lawyers for Decker consider an appeal against his sentence of two years and seven months for causing a public nuisance with his direct-action protest. , You are not responsible for your mother. You have your own losses – and young children – to deal with I am a woman in my late 30s, married with two small children with a rewarding and demanding career. I live some hours’ drive away from where I grew up and where my mum lives. I really love my life   but I need some advice regarding my relationship with my mum. My lovely dad died last year.  He was much loved and I miss him a great deal, but he gave me so much over his lifetime that I am doing OK without him. My family has probably had more loss than most. One sister died before I was born, and another older sister in her early 30s. My mum has called the loss of my dad the hardest of all. I love her very much but I feel responsible for her and guilty that I live far away.  , On his show Carlson railed against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and apologized for Putinist aggression. None of it is new Fox News has finally broken ties with its most popular star, Tucker Carlson. His ousting has been bemoaned by some commentators, who have taken Carlson to be a rebellious anti-war populist, evading easy political characterization. But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology? In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a pro-Russia monologue urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the real enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States. … It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence. , Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have both been accused of ethics violations – and John Roberts refuses to discuss the matter with Congress It was a short letter. John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, was brief in his missive to Democratic senator Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence”, Roberts declined to appear before the committee to discuss disturbing recent revelations of ethics violations at the court. Congress is meant to exert checks on judicial power – to investigate or even impeach judges who abuse their office or interpret the law in ways that violate its spirit, and to affirm that the elected branches will hold more sway over policy than the appointed one. But the chief justice’s show of indifference to congressional oversight authority reflects a new reality: that there are now effectively no checks on the power of the court – at least none that Democrats have the political will to use – and that the justices can be assured that they will face no repercussions even if they act in flagrant violation of ethical standards. It seems that they intend to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist ,  The latest news, previews and press conferences Any comments?

Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race. Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation. , Tyler Dupree, James Harrison and Matty Ashton have left part-time rugby league behind and are now in line to face France  Ever heard the one about the electrician, the lifeguard and the builder who went on to represent their country? There could be as many as 15 debutants when a new-look England side takes to the field against France in Warrington on Saturday afternoon, with Shaun Wane sticking to his promise of ripping up the squad that fell short in last year’s Rugby League World Cup and integrating a younger group of players in anticipation for the next tournament in France in 2025. All of those players have their own unique stories to tell, but three in particular can scarcely believe they have reached this point. As recently as 18 months ago, Tyler Dupree and James Harrison were not even full-time Super League players, with Dupree involved in the Oldham side relegated to League 1, the sport’s lowest professional tier, and Harrison playing for Featherstone Rovers. They were released by Leeds and Bradford respectively as teenagers, told they were not good enough and, cast aside from the professional ranks, forced to go part-time. , Suella Braverman flags statutory instrument to public order bill as climate protesters renew campaign Suella Braverman is to give police the power to ban slow walking in traffic by protesters, as Just Stop Oil enters the fifth consecutive day of using the tactic in the latest phase of its climate protest campaign.
